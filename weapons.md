# Weapons and Equipment

The following weapons, armor, and equipment are not an exhaustive list of items that may be available in a feudal Japan inspired setting. Players and Guides may use and stat additional items as needed.


### Weapon Types

Weapons can deal 3 types of **damage**: 



* **Piercing**. Rolling the maximum value on your damage roll makes your attack ignore all armor. This ability only works if you use the regular damage die for the weapon (i.e., if you are using Impaired/Enhanced, not on an Impaired d4 attack.)
* **Bludgeoning**. Always ignores 1 armor.
* **Slashing**. Deals +1 damage against targets without armor.

Weapons take up **1 inventory slot** unless marked as **Bulky**. Bulky weapons also require two hands to wield.


### Weapon Skills



* **Heavy X**: Ignore X points of ARMOR, but DAMAGE rolls of X or lower completely miss.
* **Sweep X**: DAMAGE rolls of X or higher grant one bonus attack on another target in Melee range. You can’t chain this effect for multiple bonus attacks.
* **Counter X:** DAMAGE rolls of X or less against you are bounced back against your attacker.
* **Shock X:** DAMAGE rolls of X or higher trigger a STR Save - on a failure, the target loses its next turn.
* **Quick X:** When deciding who goes first when up against a weapon of the same damage die, treat your DEX as being X higher.


### Learning How To Use A Weapon

Weapons require **Training** and experience to be used effectively.


#### Damage Type Proficiency

To use a weapon’s ***Damage Type*** effects, such as *bludgeoning*, *piercing*, or *slashing*, players need:

**Training** with *any weapon of that type* for short term gain of 1 in-game month.


#### Weapon Skill Proficiency

To use the ***Weapon Skill*** (**Heavy**, **Sweep**, etc.) of an individual weapon, players need:

* **Training** with *that specific weapon* for short term gain of 1 in-game month.

When picking up a different weapon with the same Skill tag (i.e., a Longsword and Scimitar both have **Sweep**), you’ll still need to gain Weapon Skill Proficiency.
