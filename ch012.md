## Overview

**Neutrality –** The Guide’s role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

**Classless –** A character’s role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry, and their experiences define their specialty.

**Death** – Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.

**Fiction First –** Dice do not always reflect an obstacle’s difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the Guide in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements.

**Growth –** Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

**Player Choice –** Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they’ve made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

**Principles** – The Guide and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

**Shared Objectives -** Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Players

**Agency**: Your character is defined by their actions. Be creative with your intuition, equipment, and relationships and use how your character has grown to inform your play.

**Teamwork**: Work together to determine goals and accomplish more as a group than alone.

**Exploration**: Ask questions, seek more information, and know there is no single correct way forward.

**Talking**: Treat NPCs like real people and work with them to move forward. Most people will want to talk things through before getting violent.

**Caution**: Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals. If you do fight, try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.

**Planning**: Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding. Do research and ask questions.

**Ambition**: Expect nothing. Earn your reputation. Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.

## Principles for Guides

**Information**: Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it. Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances. Be helpful, honest, and direct with your answers to their questions and remind players they can keep asking questions.

**Difficulty**: If something is easy to do, let the players do it without a save roll. Default to context and realism over numbers and mechanics. If something is impossible, no roll will allow them to do it and inform them. If a player is taking a sensible approach, let them do it. Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

**Preparation**: Be open to change. Use tables and generators to create situations, not stories or plots. NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the world. NPCs don't want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality.

**Narrative Focus**: Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization. Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path. A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.

**Danger**: The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player characters. Make sure the players know when danger is present, the more dangerous the more obvious. Put traps in plain sight and let players take time to figure out a solution. Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.

**Treasure/Loot**: A Treasure or Loot is specific to the environment from where it is recovered. It tells a story. It should be highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige. Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.

**Choice**: Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls. Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague. Work together with this conversational progress to keep the game moving. Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world.
