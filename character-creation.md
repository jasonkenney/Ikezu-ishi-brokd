# Creating Your Character


<i>A man is a castle, a man is a stone wall, a man is a moat, mercy is your friend, revenge is your enemy.
<em>- Takeda Shingen</em>

## Roll Attributes

* **Roll Under System:** When rolling a save, PCs roll a d20 against an appropriate attribute. If they roll equal to or under that attribute, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.</i>

Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:

### Strength (STR) / 力 (Chikara – Power) 
Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.


### Dexterity (DEX) / 機敏 (Kibin - Agility) 
Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

### Willpower (WIL) / 気合 (Kiai – Fighting Spirit) 
Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate, etc.

When creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character's attributes, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

## Roll Hit Protection (HP)

<i>**Remember**: HP stands for “hit protection,” reflecting a character’s ability to avoid damage through speed, guile, strength, or other non-armor means.</i>

Roll 1d6 to determine PC's starting Hit Protection (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. 

HP does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see **Healing and Recovery** on page ). If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the **Scars** **Table** (page ).

A PC’s base HP can be increased by **Wounds,** **Scars,** and gameplay but can never be higher than 3d6.


## Choose a Background

Players may choose or roll d20 against the **Background Table** to determine part of the PC’s past.

Backgrounds provide flavor to PCs. While not a Class, a background helps inform knowledge and skills which may be handy in certain situations. It may also impact interactions within the game.

## Starting Gear

All PCs begin with a kate-bukuro (provision bag) with 6 slots and Starting Gear listed for their **Background**. The Guide may allow players to select gear from the **Equipment Table **(page ).


## Inventory

PCs have a total of 10 inventory slots:



* six slots in a kate-bukuro
* one slot for each hand
* two slots for their upper body

Inventory is abstract and can be rearranged per the Guide's discretion.

Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A character cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, mules, or other equipment can increase inventory. **Retainers **(page ) can also be paid to carry equipment.


## Inventory Slots



* Most items take up one slot, unless otherwise indicated.
* **Petty** items do not take up any slots and can be bundled together.
* **Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry.
* A bag of coins worth less than 100ryu is petty and does not occupy a slot. 


## Finishing Touches

Roll PC’s **Age** (2d20+10).

Players may fill out the rest of their character sheets as they see fit, or by using the following tables. These can be used for further developing characters and by Guides for creating NPCs and plot threads.
