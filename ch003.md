<div id="roll-attributes" class="section level2">

## Roll Attributes

**Roll Under System**: When rolling a save, PCs roll a d20 against an appropriate attribute. If they roll **equal to or under** that attribute, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:

<div id="strength-str-筋力-kinryoku-strength" class="section level3 Abilities-Highlight">

### Strength (STR) / 筋力 (Kinryoku – Strength)

> Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

</div>

<div id="dexterity-dex-敏捷力-binshouryoku---agility" class="section level3">

### Dexterity (DEX) / 敏捷力 (Binshouryoku - Agility)

> Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

</div>

<div id="willpower-wil-気合-kiai-fighting-spirit" class="section level3">

### Willpower (WIL) / 気合 (Kiai – Fighting Spirit)

> Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate, etc.

**Attributes** are not universal descriptors. A PC with a low STR is not necessarily hopelessly weak; they can still attempt to lift a heavy door or survive a deadly fight! Their risk is simply higher.

When creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character's attributes, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

</div>

</div>

<div id="roll-hit-protection-hp" class="section level2">

## Roll Hit Protection (HP)

Roll 1d6 to determine PC's starting Hit Protection (**HP**), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat.

**Remember:** HP stands for “hit protection,” reflecting a PC’s ability to avoid damage through speed, guile, strength, or other non-armor means.

HP does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see **Healing and Recovery** on page [22](ch005.xhtml#healing-and-recovery)).

A PC’s base HP can be increased by **Wounds** and gameplay but can never be higher than 3d6.

<div id="choose-a-background" class="section level2">

## Choose a Background

**Feudalism** was present in Japan to a degree before the shogunate periods, but it was fully established in the late 12<sup>th</sup> century and codified in the 17<sup>th</sup>. This system of social stratification was ostensibly intended to promote stability, with each class having obligations to those above and responsibilities to those below.

Beginning in 1185 the Kamakura Period saw the emergence of Japan’s first military government (*bakufu*), largely sidelining the emperor and imperial court (*kure*) and leading to the rise of the samurai class. The role of the *kure* was largely ornamental, with the real power residing among the military class of the *shogun*, *shugo* and *jito* and eventually *daimyo* and *samurai*.

Players may choose or roll d20 against the **Background Table** to determine part of the PC’s past.

Backgrounds provide flavor to PCs. While not a Class, a background helps inform knowledge and skills which may be handy in certain situations. It may also impact interactions within the game.

</div>

<div id="backgrounds" class="section level2">

## Backgrounds

| D20 | BACKGROUND          | D20 | BACKGROUND                   |

<div id="starting-gear" class="section level2">

## Starting Gear

All PCs begin with a kate-bukuro (provision bag) with 6 slots and Starting Gear listed for their **Background**. The Guide may allow players to select gear from the **Equipment Table** (page [11](ch003.xhtml#upkeep-recovery-and-services-transportation-item)).

</div>

<div id="inventory" class="section level2">

## Inventory

**The Shinokosho - Four Divisions of Society** was established in the Nara Period during the 8<sup>th</sup> century and formed the basis for feudalism in shogunate Japan. Mobility between these roles was possible, but during the Tokugawa period the structure would become strictly enforced.

> **Shi** – the warrior class (*bushi*) including samurai
>
> **No** - farming peasants
>
> **Ko** - craftsmen and artisans
>
> **Sho** - merchants
>
> Priests and monks existed beside this structure, respected by all levels. Below were *burakumin*, people engaged in occupations considered impure or tainted by death, such as executioners and butchers. Also outside of the system were actors, criminals, and courtesans.

PCs have a total of 10 inventory slots:

- six slots in a kate-bukuro

- one slot for each hand

- two slots for their upper body

Inventory is abstract and can be rearranged per the Guide's discretion.

Anyone with a full inventory (filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A character cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts, horses, mules, or other equipment can increase inventory. **Retainers** (page [24](ch005.xhtml#id__Ref176341400)) can also be paid to carry equipment.

</div>

<div id="inventory-slots" class="section level2">

## Inventory Slots

- Most items take up one slot, unless otherwise indicated.

- **Petty** items do not take up any slots and can be bundled together.

- **Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry.

- A bag of coins worth less than 100 ryo is petty and does not occupy a slot.

## Female Names

Upon reaching adulthood, children would receive a **call name (*azana*)** to be used instead of their given name.

*Genpuku* is a coming-of-age ceremony which originated during the 8th century. The ceremony marked the transition from childhood to adulthood around the age of 11-15. Often involving a sponsor of higher rank, this ceremony included the exchanging of a childhood name for an adult name (*eboshi-na*) as well as a courtesy name (azana), the adoption of adult clothing, and assumption of adult responsibilities.

An azana would typically be used instead of one's given adult name for everyday use. It was believed that knowing someone's real name could grant power over them. A real name was typically used only in interactions with the emperor, official acts and appointments, or in death.

## Weapons and Equipment

**Weapon Types and Skills** from Lars Huijbregts’ *Block, Dodge, Parry* are a great way to add depth to combat and give weapons a closer feel to their real-world counterparts. These rules can also be used by the Guide for creating legendary and named weapons.

The following weapons, armor, and equipment are not an exhaustive list of items that may be available in a feudal Japan inspired setting. Players and Guides may use and stat additional items as needed.

<div id="weapon-types" class="section level3">

### Weapon Types

Weapons can deal 3 types of **damage**:

- **Bludgeoning**. Always ignores 1 armor.

- **Slashing**. Deals +1 damage against targets without armor.

- **Piercing**. Rolling the maximum value on your damage roll makes your attack ignore all armor. This ability only works if you use the regular damage die for the weapon (i.e., if you are using Impaired/Enhanced, not on an Impaired d4 attack.)

Weapons take up **1 inventory slot** unless marked as **Bulky**. Bulky weapons also require two hands to wield.

</div>

<div id="weapon-skills" class="section level3">

### Weapon Skills

- **Counter X:** Damage rolls of X or less against you are bounced back against your attacker.

- **Heavy X**: Ignore X points of Armor, but Damage rolls of X or lower completely miss.

- **Shock X:** Damage rolls of X or higher trigger a STR Save - on a failure, the target loses its next turn.

- **Sweep X**: Damage rolls of X or higher grant one bonus attack on another target in Melee range. You can’t chain this effect for multiple bonus attacks.

- **Quick X:** When deciding who goes first when up against a weapon of the same damage die, treat your DEX as being X higher.

</div>

<div id="learning-how-to-use-a-weapon" class="section level3">

### Learning How To Use A Weapon

Weapons require **Training** (page [44](ch007.xhtml#training)) and experience to be used effectively.

<div id="damage-type-proficiency" class="section level4">

#### Damage Type Proficiency

To use a weapon’s ***Damage Type*** effects, such as *bludgeoning, piercing,* or *slashing*, players need:

- **Training** with *any weapon of that type* for short term gain of 1 in-game month.

</div>

<div id="weapon-skill-proficiency" class="section level4">

#### Weapon Skill Proficiency

To use the ***Weapon Skill*** effects, such as *heavy*, *sweep*, etc, of an individual weapon, players need:

- **Training** with *that specific weapon* for short term gain of 1 in-game month.

When picking up a different weapon with the same Skill tag (i.e., a Longsword and Scimitar both have **Sweep**), you’ll still need to gain Weapon Skill Proficiency.

### Equipment Rarity

The availability of equipment can vary between towns and regions. Larger settlements have a more varied selection than smaller. The Guide may use **Rarity** to determine equipment available based on the size of the settlement (see **Settlement Size** on page [39](ch007.xhtml#light-sources)) or may determine item availability based on the attributes of the location.

| \# | RARITY | AVAILABILITY |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **1** | Common | Regularly available items that can be found in any settlement of 100 people (town) or more. |
| **2** | Uncommon | Regionally specific items that can be found in settlements of 1000 people (Market Town) or more. |
| **3** | Rare | Specialized or more expensive items that can be found in settlements of 5,000 people (Castle Town) or more. |
| **4** | Exclusive | Items with a very specific purpose or requiring expert craftsman, found in settlements of 10,000+ people (City) or specific schools |
