# Rules

<i>Ultimately you must forget about technique. The further you progress, the fewer teachings there are. The Great Path is really no path.</i>

<em>- Morihei Ueshiba</em>

## Attributes

Each of the three **attributes** are used in different circumstances (see **Saves**).

### Strength (STR) / *力 *(Chikara* – Power*) 
Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

### Dexterity (DEX) / *機敏* (Kibin - Agility)
Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

### Willpower (WIL) / 気合 (Kiai – Fighting Spirit)
Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate, etc.

## Saves

A **Save** is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. PCs roll a d20 for an appropriate attribute. If they roll ***<span style="text-decoration:underline;">equal to or under that attribute</span>***, they pass. Otherwise, they fail.

* A 1 is always a success.
* A 20 is always a failure.

If two opponents are each trying to overcome the other, whoever is most at risk should save.

If two characters need to take an action together, whoever is most at risk should save (usually the character with the lowest relevant **Attribute**).

### When To Save

It is assumed characters are capable of simple activities, smart decisions, and specialized tasks tied to their backgrounds that do not require a save roll.

A character should **Save** only if one or more of the following conditions are met:

* When the outcome of an action is uncertain.
* When something is at risk (a life, a danger, etc.).
* When making a critical damage save during combat.

Saves can happen both in and out of combat. A Save is almost never required when a character is under attack, as attacks hit automatically. 

However, there are situations in which the story might dictate that an attack is automatically unsuccessful or impossible.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

If a PC is in an advantageous position for a Save, or has a special ability for the circumstances, they have **Advantage** (ADV) and they can roll 2d20 and take the better result.

If a PC is in a disadvantageous position for a Save, or have a specific hinderance, they have **Disadvantage** (DIS) and they must roll 2d20 and take the worse result.


## Healing and Recovery

Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP but leaves the party exposed. 

Attribute loss (see **Critical Damage** on page ) can usually be restored with a week's rest facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise. 

Some of these services may be free, while more expedient or mystical means of recovery may come at a cost.


## Deprivation and Fatigue

A PC that lacks a critical need (such as food or rest) is **Deprived** and unable to recover HP or attributes. 

Anyone **Deprived** for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a full night's rest in a safe spot).

PCs can also gain **Fatigue** through events in the fiction.

If a character is forced to add **Fatigue** to their inventory but they have no free slots, they must drop an item from their inventory.


## Armor

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls. 

Shields and similar armor provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.

No PC can have more than +3 Armor.

Equipment may provide additional benefits according to their use.


## NPC Reactions

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Guide may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>2
   </td>
   <td>3-5
   </td>
   <td>6-8
   </td>
   <td>9-11
   </td>
   <td>12
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Hostile
   </td>
   <td>Wary
   </td>
   <td>Curious
   </td>
   <td>Kind
   </td>
   <td>Helpful
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



## Morale

Enemy NPCs must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when the first member of their group dies and again when they lose half their number. 

Some groups may use their leader's WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 HP or less. Morale does not affect PCs.


## Retainers

PCs can hire **retainers** to aid them. 

To create a retainer: roll 3d6 for each attribute, then give them 1d6 HP and a simple weapon (d6), then continue to roll on the **[Character Creation](#bookmark=id.1t3h5sf)** tables to further flesh them out. Or choose a character from the **50 Pregenerated Characters** in **Appendix C** (page ). Retainers cost between 1-3ryu per day, or a share of whatever treasure the party obtains.


## Luck – 運 (Un)

Sometimes there will be an element of randomness without rolling a **Save**, particularly in situations dictated by luck or which fall outside of Attributes.

For these situations roll a d6. 



* A low roll favors the PC
* A high roll means bad luck for the PC

The Guide decides what a specific result means for the situation at hand.

Currency is broken down into minted ingots and coins of precious metals:

1 gold **ryu** ingot is equal to 10 silver **bu** coins and 100 copper **shu** coins.

Treasure is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.

Villages, strongholds, and ports of call barter and trade based on the local rarity and value of an item or commodity.




## Training


### Weapon Types and Skills

Training requires finding a trainer for a specific skill. This can be to gain a bonus to an attribute, with a specific weapon type or skill, or other advancements.

Training occurs at a specific location – finding a school that specifically teaches naginatajutsu (fighting with a naginata) – or with an individual – finding a thief to teach how to pick a lock.

Hiring a trainer will cost 10 ryu per day (or other incentives other than ryu).

Players must say how long their PC is training for and pay the Ryu cost before rolling for a success. 

When the number of days has passed, PCs must roll **d10 equal to or under the number of days** they trained to gain a modifier.

PC’s gain +1 to the target roll under number for each time they successfully trained for this skill in the past. 

A player must always roll to see if they gain the modifier, even if the target number is greater than 10.

A 10 is an automatic failure.

Example: Iyo is a wishes to train in bojutsu

For example, if a player spends 7 days (and 70 ryu) training, they must roll d10 under 7.

So for the previous example, if the player successfully gained this modifier through training twice in the past, they would train for 7 days, then roll a d10 to equal or under 9.

Modifiers gained by training are temporary and only last 30 days of in-game time, unless the PC has successfully trained again for that skill during that time.

PCs may train for different modifiers provided they have the time and ryu necessary. 

PCs cannot stack modifiers. Training for the same skill when the PC already has a modifier only resets the 30-day expiration clock.


### Increasing Abilities

A PC can increase their Abilities through training. This training costs 200 ryu per week. At the end of the week, roll a D20. If they roll above their current maximum ability score, it increases by 1. An ability cannot be raised above 18.



* **Strength Training** 1an be given by physically strong trainers, such as sailors, blacksmiths, and soldiers.
* **Dexterity Training** can be given by thieves, assassins, and hunters.
* **Willpower Training** can be given by magic-users, priests, or similar folk.


#### Crucial Saves

Abilities can also be increased by failing Ability Saves in dramatic moments. When a player is about to make a dramatic, important Save in a moment with high stakes, the Warden can declare it a Crucial Save. After laying out the consequences of success and failure within the fiction, the player rolls their dice. If they fail the Save, the used Ability has its maximum increased by 1.


## Finding A Trainer

Not every town or village necessarily has the same available resources as another. Same goes for training – there may be a region better known for certain skills than others. Perhaps what a PC needs to learn is only taught by a particular religious sect at one temple in the far, distant north.

The Guide can let players know where they’ll need to travel and who they’ll need to talk to for training and advancement, or the following tables can be used to help generate a story.
