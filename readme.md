# Ikezu-Ishi

**Ikezu-Ishi** (Malicious Rock) is a feudal Japan inspired hack of **Cairn** by Yochai Gal, **Into the Odd** by Chris McDowall, and **Block, Dodge, Parry** by Lars Huijbregts.

The rules and tables in Ikezu-Ishi are meant to help players create a vibrant setting and adventure for one or many play sessions. While inspired by Japanese mythology and feudal society, Ikezu-ishi is not meant to be a history book and can be quite anachronistic, mixing political, social, and cultural elements from the Kamakura Period (1192-1333) through the early Tokugawa (Edo) Period (1603-1868). Efforts have been made to avoid stereotypes, orientalism, and interchanging Asian cultures, though there are some existing historical influences from China, Korea, and elsewhere.

Citing this in an academic setting will more than likely result in a terrible outcome, but if you want to play Samurai-ish and hunt Yokai-like creatures in an OSR style game then youâ€™re in the right place.
