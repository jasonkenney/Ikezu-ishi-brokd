IKEZU-ISHI QUICK REFERENCE

CORE RULES

Attributes (page [22])

***STR*:** Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, resisting poison, etc.

***DEX*:** Used for saves requiring poise and speed, like dodging, climbing, balancing, etc.

***WIL*:** Used for saves to persuade, deceive, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate, etc.

Saves (page [23])

Roll to avoid bad outcomes from risk. PCs roll a d20 for an appropriate attribute. If they roll ***[equal to or under that attribute]{.underline}***, they pass.

**1 is always a success, 20 is always a failure.**

It is assumed characters are capable of simple activities that do not require a save roll.

If two opponents are each trying to overcome the other, whoever is most at risk should save.

If two characters take an action together, whoever is most at risk should save.

Saves can happen both in and out of combat.

Advantage and Disadvantage (page [23][1])

Characters in an advantageous position, or with a relevant special ability, have **Advantage** (ADV) and roll 2d20 and take the better result.

Characters in a disadvantageous position, or with a specific hinderance, have **Disadvantage** (DIS) and roll 2d20 and take the worse result.

Healing and Recovery (page [23][2])

Resting for a few moments and drinking water restores lost HP but leaves the party exposed.

Attribute loss can usually be restored with a week\'s rest with a healer or other source.

Some of these services may be free, while more expedient or mystical means come at a cost.

Deprivation and Fatigue (page [24])

A PC that lacks a critical need (food or rest) is **Deprived**, unable to recover HP or attributes.

Anyone deprived more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory each day. Each Fatigue occupies one slot until they recuperate. PCs can also gain **Fatigue** through events in the fiction.

If a character adds **Fatigue** but has no free slots, they must drop an item from inventory.

Characters with a full inventory have 0 HP.

Armor (page [24][3])

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target\'s **Armor** value from the damage roll.

No PC can have more than +3 Armor.

Morale (page [24][4])

NPC groups must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when the first member of their group dies and again when losing half their number.

Some groups use their leader\'s WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save at 0 HP or less.

Morale does not affect PCs.

Retainers (page [25])

PCs can hire retainers to aid them. They cost between 1-3 ryo per day, or a share of treasure.

Luck (page [25][5])

For situations dictated by luck or which fall outside of Attributes roll a d6.

Low roll favors the PC, high means bad.

The Guide decides what a result means.

Wealth (page [25][5])

1 gold **ryo** ingot is equal to 10 silver **bu** coins and 100 copper **shu** coins.

COMBAT

Rounds (page [29])

Where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when things occur. A **round** is ten seconds in game and is comprised of **turns**.

*During the first round of combat*, each PC must make a DEX save to act before opponents. Circumstances, items, or skills may negate this requirement. PCs that save may take their turn. PCs that fail their save will not act this round.

Opponents then take their turn, and the first-round ends. The next round begins with all PCs able taking their turn, followed by their opponents, and so on until combat has ended.

Actions (page [29][6])

On their turn, a PC may move up to 20ft or one distance (from Melee to Reach, etc.) and take up to one action: attacking, making a second move, or some other reasonable action.

Each round, the PCs declare actions before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky, the Guide calls for a save. All actions occur simultaneously.

Range Bands (page [30])

The distance of an attack falls into three abstract ranges: **melee**, **reach**, and **ranged**.

Each weapon has an optimal distance. Unless noted, a weapon is considered **melee**.

**Melee**: Attack within arm's reach.

**Reach:** A short distance and foe out of arm's reach.

**Ranged**: Attack foes from a long distance.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  RANGE                   MELEE             REACH            RANGED
  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------
  Melee                                      DIS           Can not use

  Reach                    DIS                                 DIS

  Ranged               Can not use           DIS        
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ammunition is not tracked unless specified.

Attacking and Damage (page [30][7])

Attacks in combat automatically hit.

Attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts target\'s Armor, then deals the remaining to opponent\'s HP. If the opponent has no remaining HP, see **Critical Damage**.

Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.

If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the highest result.

If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, use the **Scars Table** (page [35]) to see how they are impacted.

Attack Modifiers (page [31])

Weapons can be one of 3 **Weapon Types**: Piercing, Bludgeoning, or Slashing. Many weapons have a specific **Weapon Skill** (Heavy, Sweep, etc) that provides an additional impact on combat.

Players must have downtime training to gain use of Damage Type and Weapon Skill effect.

If fighting from a position of weakness, the attack is at a **DIS,** the attacker must roll their weapon die twice and take the lowest result.

If fighting from a position of strength, the attack is at an **ADV**, the attacker rolls their weapon die twice and keeps the highest result.

**Blast:** Attacks with the **blast** affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each. If unsure how many targets are affected, roll the related damage die for a result.

**Dual Weapons:** If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result.

Critical Damage (page [32])

Damage that reduces a target\'s HP below 0 decreases a target\'s **STR** by the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical damage**. On success, the target is still in the fight and must continue to make Critical Damage saves when incurring damage.

Any character that suffers critical damage cannot do anything but grasp for life. If left untreated, they die within the hour.

Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage save.

NPCs and monsters that fail a Critical Damage save are dead, per the Guide's discretion.

Attribute Loss (page [32][8])

If STR is reduced to 0, PCs die.

If DEX is reduced to 0, PCs are paralyzed.

If WIL is reduced to 0, PCs are delirious.

Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by other means.

If a character takes damage outside of combat, they should instead receive damage to an **Attribute**, typically STR.

Character Death (page [30])

When a character dies, the player may create a new character or control a retainer. They immediately join the party to reduce downtime.

Wounds (page [33])

Adventuring is dangerous. A way to reflect that is to use these wounds. A wound occupies a **slot** in your **inventory**.

The 1st time a PC receives a **Permanent Wound**, *[gain 1d6 HP]{.underline}*.

Retreat (page [34])

Running away from a situation always requires a DEX save, as well as a safe destination.

Scars (page [34][9])

If damage to a PC would reduce their HP to exactly 0, look up the result on the **Scars Table** (page [35]) based on the amount of HP lost in the attack.

The 1st time a PC receives a **Scar**, *[gain 1d6 HP]{.underline}*.

### Introduction

**Ikezu-Ishi** (Malicious Rock) is a feudal Japan inspired hack of **Cairn** by Yochai Gal, **Into the Odd** by Chris McDowall, and **Block, Dodge, Parry** by Lars Huijbregts. Players are citizens of a land in the midst of war and fear, many just trying to survive, some trying to get rich, others just seeking the thrill of adventure.

Throughout this book you will find side notes that include examples, clarifications, citations, historical information, and more. They are presented for informational purposes and any impact on the game is optional.

The rules and tables in **Ikezu-Ishi** are meant to help players create a vibrant setting and adventure for one or many play sessions. While inspired by Japanese mythology and feudal society, Ikezu-ishi is not meant to be a history book and can be quite anachronistic, mixing political, social, and cultural elements from the Kamakura Period (1192-1333) through the early Tokugawa (Edo) Period (1603-1868). Efforts have been made to avoid stereotypes, orientalism, and interchanging Asian cultures, though there are some existing historical influences from China, Korea, and elsewhere.

Citing this in an academic setting will more than likely result in a terrible outcome, but if you want to play Samurai-ish and hunt Yokai-like creatures in an OSR style game then you're in the right place.

# Overview and Principles

Fall seven times, rise eight.

\- Japanese proverb

![P159#yIS1]

Utagawa Kunisada, *Fight atop the roof of Horyukaku temple*, Ca. 1840, woodblock print.

## Overview

See **Appendix A** (page [104]) for more Principles for Players and Guides.

**Classless --** A character's role or skills are defined by the equipment they carry and their experiences, not their class.

**Fiction First --** Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Success and failure are arbitrated by dialogue, based on in-world elements.

**Growth --** Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

**Player Choice --** Players should understand the reasons behind their choices, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

**Principles** -- The Guide and the players have guidelines to help foster a play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

## Being Respectfully Inspired

The following are just a few examples of ways players can be inspired by a setting without devolving into a caricature of bad stereotypes.

**Don't perpetuate stereotypes**: Research and get to know and enjoy aspects of the culture. Play a fleshed-out character, not an orientalist fantasy.

**Don't do accents**: Describe how people talk and let your words show the character's speech.

**Don't obsess over honorifics in speech:** Over-usage isn't necessary. If anything, default to degrees of politeness you may use yourself. You speak differently among friends than you do with grandma than you do with the boss.

**Don't obsess over "honor" as a motivation**: The focus on "duty" and "honor" distills a character to a trope that can quickly be exaggerated.

## Combat As War

Yes, Sun Tzu was a Chinese general and strategist. While *Ikezu-ishi* strives to avoid blanket "orientalism," sometimes a quote is just too good to not use.

To win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.

-- Sun Tzu

*There's no such thing as a clean fight.*

*-- Dad*

Combat in this game is not fair, but it is also not inevitable. Guides and players should seek different ways to resolve situations and encounters, using skills, equipment, and storytelling to create their adventure. While combat may not always be avoidable, facing an enemy requires strategizing and trying to stack the odds in your favor -- and always being ready to retreat when things go wrong.

# Creating Your Character

A man is a castle, a man is a stone wall, a man is a moat, mercy is your friend, revenge is your enemy.

\- Takeda Shingen

![P187#yIS1]

Yoshu Chikanobu, Samurai Kojima Takanori writing on a Cherry Tree, 1898, woodblock print.

## Roll Attributes

**Roll Under System**: When rolling a save, PCs roll a d20 against an appropriate attribute. If they roll **equal to or under** that attribute, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:

### Strength (STR) / 筋力 (Kinryoku -- Strength)  {#strength-str-筋力-kinryoku-strength .Abilities-Highlight}

> Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

### Dexterity (DEX) / 敏捷力 (Binshouryoku - Agility) 

> Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

### Willpower (WIL) / 気合 (Kiai -- Fighting Spirit) 

> Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate, etc.

When creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character\'s attributes, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

## Roll Hit Protection (HP)

**Remember:** HP stands for "hit protection," reflecting a character's ability to avoid damage through speed, guile, strength, or other non-armor means.

Roll 1d6 to determine PC\'s starting Hit Protection (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat.

HP does not indicate a character\'s health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see **Healing and Recovery** on page [23][2]). If an attack takes a PC\'s HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the **Scars** **Table** (page [35]).

A PC's base HP can be increased by **Wounds,** **Scars,** and gameplay but can never be higher than 3d6.

**Feudalism** was present in Japan to a degree before the shogunate periods, but it was fully established in the late 12^th^ century and codified in the 17^th^. This system of social stratification was ostensibly intended to promote stability, with each class having obligations to those above and responsibilities to those below.

Beginning in 1185 the Kamakura Period saw the emergence of Japan's first military government (*bakufu*), largely sidelining the emperor and imperial court (*kure*) and leading to the rise of the samurai class. The role of the *kure* was largely ornamental, with the real power residing among the military class of the *shogun*, *shugo* and *jito* and eventually *daimyo* and *samurai*.

## Choose a Background

Players may choose or roll d20 against the **Background Table** to determine part of the PC's past.

Backgrounds provide flavor to PCs. While not a Class, a background helps inform knowledge and skills which may be handy in certain situations. It may also impact interactions within the game.

## Backgrounds

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  BACKGROUND (D20)                                         
  ------------------ ---------------------------- -------- ------------------------------
  **1**              Bandit (Sanzoku)             **11**   Miner (Kofu)

  **2**              Blacksmith (Kaji)            **12**   Mountain Ascetic (Yamabushi)

  **3**              Carpenter (Daiku)            **13**   Ninja (Shinobi)

  **4**              Cleric (Souryo)              **14**   Performer (Geinoujin)

  **5**              Gambler (Tobakushi)          **15**   Pirate (Kaizoku)

  **6**              Farmer (Hyakushou)           **16**   Ronin (Ronin)

  **7**              Fisherman (Ryoushi)          **17**   Samurai (Samurai)

  **8**              Herbalist (Kusushi)          **18**   Servant (Kerai)

  **9**              Hunter (Shuryousha)          **19**   Soldier (Ashigaru)

  **10**             Merchant (Gyousha)           **20**   Tea Master (Chajin)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Starting Gear

All PCs begin with a kate-bukuro (provision bag) with 6 slots and Starting Gear listed for their **Background**. The Guide may allow players to select gear from the **Equipment Table** (page [12]).

## Inventory

**The Shinokosho - Four Divisions of Society** was established in the Nara Period during the 8^th^ century and formed the basis for feudalism in shogunate Japan. Initially these classes were not set by wealth or capital but by Confucian views of moral purity. Mobility between these roles was possible, but during the Tokugawa period in the 17^th^ century, the structure was strictly enforced.

> **Shi** -- the warrior class (*bushi*) including samurai
>
> **No** - farming peasants
>
> **Ko** - craftsmen and artisans
>
> **Sho** - merchants
>
> While the lower classes of peasants, craftsmen, and merchants were historically viewed as a stratified hierarchy, modern research suggests they were less a pecking order and more social classifications.
>
> Priests and monks existed beside this structure, respected by all levels. Below were *burakumin*, people engaged in occupations considered impure or tainted by death, such as executioners and butchers. Also outside of the system were actors, criminals, and courtesans.

PCs have a total of 10 inventory slots:

-   six slots in a kate-bukuro

-   one slot for each hand

-   two slots for their upper body

Inventory is abstract and can be rearranged per the Guide\'s discretion.

Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A character cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, mules, or other equipment can increase inventory. **Retainers** (page [25]) can also be paid to carry equipment.

## Inventory Slots

-   Most items take up one slot, unless otherwise indicated.

-   **Petty** items do not take up any slots and can be bundled together.

-   **Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry.

-   A bag of coins worth less than 100ryu is petty and does not occupy a slot.

## Finishing Touches

Roll PC's **Age** (2d20+10).

Players may fill out the rest of their character sheets as they see fit, or by using the following tables. These can be used for further developing characters and by Guides for creating NPCs and plot threads.

## Female Names

**Call Name (Azana)**

Upon reaching adulthood, children would receive a call name (*azana*) to be used instead of their given name.

*Genpuku* is a coming-of-age ceremony which originated during the 8th century. The ceremony marked the transition from childhood to adulthood around the age of 11-15. Often involving a sponsor of higher rank, this ceremony included the exchanging of a childhood name for an adult name (*eboshi-na*) as well as a courtesy name (azana), the adoption of adult clothing, and assumption of adult responsibilities.

An azana would typically be used instead of one\'s given adult name for everyday use. It was believed that knowing someone\'s real name could grant power over them. A real name was typically used only in interactions with the emperor, official acts and appointments, or in death.

## Weapons and Equipment

The following weapons, armor, and equipment are not an exhaustive list of items that may be available in a feudal Japan inspired setting. Players and Guides may use and stat additional items as needed.

### Weapon Types

Weapons can deal 3 types of **damage**:

-   **Piercing**. Rolling the maximum value on your damage roll makes your attack ignore all armor. This ability only works if you use the regular damage die for the weapon (i.e., if you are using Impaired/Enhanced, not on an Impaired d4 attack.)

-   **Bludgeoning**. Always ignores 1 armor.

-   **Slashing**. Deals +1 damage against targets without armor.

Weapons take up **1 inventory slot** unless marked as **Bulky**. Bulky weapons also require two hands to wield.

### Weapon Skills

-   **Heavy X**: Ignore X points of ARMOR, but DAMAGE rolls of X or lower completely miss.

-   **Sweep X**: DAMAGE rolls of X or higher grant one bonus attack on another target in Melee range. You can't chain this effect for multiple bonus attacks.

-   **Counter X:** DAMAGE rolls of X or less against you are bounced back against your attacker.

-   **Shock X:** Damage rolls of X or higher trigger a STR Save - on a failure, the target loses its next turn.

-   **Quick X:** When deciding who goes first when up against a weapon of the same damage die, treat your DEX as being X higher.

### Learning How To Use A Weapon

Weapons require **Training** (page [26]) and experience to be used effectively.

#### Damage Type Proficiency

To use a weapon's ***Damage Type*** effects, such as *bludgeoning, piercing,* or *slashing*, players need:

-   **Training** with *any weapon of that type* for short term gain of 1 in-game month.

#### Weapon Skill Proficiency

**Weapon Types** **and Skills** from Lars Huijbregts' *Block, Dodge, Parry* are a great way to add depth to combat and give weapons a closer feel to their real-world counterparts. These rules can also be used by the Guide for creating legendary and named weapons.

To use the ***Weapon Skill*** (**Heavy**, **Sweep**, etc.) of an individual weapon, players need:

-   **Training** with *that specific weapon* for short term gain of 1 in-game month.

When picking up a different weapon with the same Skill tag (i.e., a Longsword and Scimitar both have **Sweep**), you'll still need to gain Weapon Skill Proficiency.

### Slashing Weapons

![P1935#yIS1]

Artist Unknown, Master swordsmith Goro Masamune forges a katana with an assistant, 18th century, woodblock print.

[]{#_Ref176341285 .anchor}Ultimately you must forget about technique. The further you progress, the fewer teachings there are. The Great Path is really no path.

\- Morihei Ueshiba

## Attributes

Each of the three **attributes** are used in different circumstances (see **Saves**).

### Strength (STR) / 筋力 *(Kinryoku -- Strength)*  {#strength-str-筋力-kinryoku-strength-1 .Abilities-Highlight}

> Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

### Dexterity (DEX) / 敏捷力 (Binshouryoku - Agility) 

> Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

### *Willpower (WIL) /* 気合 *(Kiai -- Fighting Spirit)* 

> Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate, etc.

## Saves

**Five Fundamental Kenjutsu Sword Stances**

*1. Central Stance: Chudan-no-kamae*

![P1950#yIS1]

The Chudan-no-kamae is a middle, balanced position that offers equal opportunities for attack and defense. Performed correctly, it protects the torso and right wrist.

*2. Elevated Stance: Jodan-no-kamae*

![P1953#yIS1]

Also known simply as Jodan, this is a high posture that involves keeping the sword aloft above the head, its tip pointed back.

*3. Lowered Stance: Gedan-no-kamae*

![P1956#yIS1]

Gedan-no-kamae is a low posture that creates the perception of a defensive posture, allowing the practitioner to parry attacks and perform counterattacks.

A **Save** is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. PCs roll a d20 for an appropriate attribute. If they roll ***[equal to or under that attribute]{.underline}***, they pass. Otherwise, they fail.

-   A 1 is always a success.

<!-- -->

-   A 20 is always a failure.

If two opponents are each trying to overcome the other, whoever is most at risk should save.

If two characters need to take an action together, whoever is most at risk should save (usually the character with the lowest relevant **Attribute**).

### When To Save

It is assumed characters are capable of simple activities, smart decisions, and specialized tasks tied to their backgrounds that do not require a save roll.

A character should **Save** only if one or more of the following conditions are met:

-   When the outcome of an action is uncertain.

-   When something is at risk (a life, a danger, etc.).

-   When making a critical damage save during combat.

Saves can happen both in and out of combat. A Save is almost never required when a character is under attack, as attacks hit automatically.

However, there are situations in which the story might dictate that an attack is automatically unsuccessful or impossible.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

If a PC is in an advantageous position for a Save, or has a special ability for the circumstances, they have **Advantage** (ADV) and they can roll 2d20 and take the better result.

If a PC is in a disadvantageous position for a Save, or have a specific hinderance, they have **Disadvantage** (DIS) and they must roll 2d20 and take the worse result.

## Healing and Recovery

Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP but leaves the party exposed.

Attribute loss (see **Critical Damage** on page [32]) can usually be restored with a week\'s rest facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise.

***Five Fundamental Kenjutsu Sword Stances (continued)***

*4. Octagonal Stance: Hasso-no-kamae*

![P1979#yIS1]

Hasso-no-kamae is an aggressive, "eight-sided" stance. This posture involves the left foot forward and holding the sword upright almost vertically, the hilt aligned with the right shoulder. Offensive in nature, it emphasizes situational awareness.

*5. Concealed Stance: Waki-no-gamae*

![P1982#yIS1]

Waki-gamae is a side posture that hides the sword behind the body, exposing only the pommel to the opponent, hiding the length of the sword to lure their opponent into striking distance.

Some of these services may be free, while more expedient or mystical means of recovery may come at a cost.

## Deprivation and Fatigue

A PC that lacks a critical need (such as food or rest) is **Deprived** and unable to recover HP or attributes.

Anyone **Deprived** for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a full night\'s rest in a safe spot).

PCs can also gain **Fatigue** through events in the fiction.

If a character is forced to add **Fatigue** to their inventory but they have no free slots, they must drop an item from their inventory.

## Armor

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target\'s **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls.

Shields and similar armor provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.

No PC can have more than +3 Armor.

Equipment may provide additional benefits according to their use.

## NPC Reactions

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Guide may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
        2             3-5            6-8            9-11            12
  -------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------
     Hostile          Wary         Curious          Kind         Helpful

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Morale

Enemy NPCs must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when the first member of their group dies and again when they lose half their number.

Some groups may use their leader\'s WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they\'re reduced to 0 HP or less. Morale does not affect PCs.

## Retainers

![P2013#yIS1]

**Omamori** is an amulet or good luck charm that helps ward off evil spirits and grant luck to the bearer. Commonly sold at shrines and temples, Omamori are made for different types of luck and typically contain a fuda, a small written prayer, then wrapped in a cloth bag with a string attached, then prayed over by a priest.

Omamori should be respected while in someone's possession. They have a lifespan of a year and keeping one longer may invite bad luck. Disposal requires returning the omamori to the temple or shrine where it was created.

PCs can hire **retainers** to aid them.

To create a retainer: roll 3d6 for each attribute, then give them 1d6 HP and a simple weapon (d6), then continue to roll on the [**Character Creation**] tables to further flesh them out. Or choose a character from the **50 Pregenerated Characters** in **Appendix C** (page [111]). Retainers cost between 1-3ryu per day, or a share of whatever treasure the party obtains.

## Luck -- 運 (Un)

Sometimes there will be an element of randomness without rolling a **Save**, particularly in situations dictated by luck or which fall outside of Attributes.

For these situations roll a d6.

-   A low roll favors the PC

<!-- -->

-   A high roll means bad luck for the PC

The Guide decides what a specific result means for the situation at hand.

## Wealth and Treasure

![P2025#yIS1]

**Omikuji**, or \"sacred lot,\" are fortunes available from temples and shrines. After a small offering, the slip is chosen at random and contains fortunes ranging from good to very bad.

Tying a bad fortune to a pine (*matsu*) tree will make your bad fortune wait (*matsu*) at the tree rather than follow you. Good fortunes can be kept or also tied to a pine so the good fortune "waits" around you for a long time. Do not draw a second fortune for it will not end well.

Currency is broken down into minted ingots and coins of precious metals:

1 gold **ryo** ingot is equal to 10 silver **bu** coins and 100 copper **shu** coins.

Treasure is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.

Villages, strongholds, and ports of call barter and trade based on the local rarity and value of an item or commodity.

### Weapon Types and Skills

Training requires finding a trainer for a specific skill. This can be to gain a bonus to an attribute, with a specific weapon type or skill, or other advancements.

Training occurs at a specific location -- finding a school that specifically teaches naginatajutsu (fighting with a naginata) -- or with an individual -- finding a thief to teach how to pick a lock.

Hiring a trainer will cost 10 ryo per day (or other incentives other than ryo).

Players must say how long their PC is training for and pay the Ryo cost before rolling for a success.

When the number of days has passed, PCs must roll **d10 equal to or under the number of days** they trained to gain a modifier.

PC's gain +1 to the target roll under number for each time they successfully trained for this skill in the past.

A player must always roll to see if they gain the modifier, even if the target number is greater than 10.

A 10 is an automatic failure.

Example: Iyo is a wishes to train in bojutsu

For example, if a player spends 7 days (and 70 ryo) training, they must roll d10 under 7.

So for the previous example, if the player successfully gained this modifier through training twice in the past, they would train for 7 days, then roll a d10 to equal or under 9.

Modifiers gained by training are temporary and only last 30 days of in-game time, unless the PC has successfully trained again for that skill during that time.

PCs may train for different modifiers provided they have the time and ryo necessary.

PCs cannot stack modifiers. Training for the same skill when the PC already has a modifier only resets the 30-day expiration clock.

### Increasing Abilities

A PC can increase their Abilities through training. This training costs 200 ryo per week. At the end of the week, roll a D20. If they roll above their current maximum ability score, it increases by 1. An ability cannot be raised above 18.

-   **Strength Training** can be given by physically strong trainers, such as sailors, blacksmiths, and soldiers.

-   **Dexterity Training** can be given by thieves, assassins, and hunters.

-   **Willpower Training** can be given by magic-users, priests, or similar folk.

#### Crucial Saves

Abilities can also be increased by failing Ability Saves in dramatic moments. When a player is about to make a dramatic, important Save in a moment with high stakes, the Warden can declare it a Crucial Save. After laying out the consequences of success and failure within the fiction, the player rolls their dice. If they fail the Save, the used Ability has its maximum increased by 1.

## Finding A Trainer

Not every town or village necessarily has the same available resources as another. Same goes for training -- there may be a region better known for certain skills than others. Perhaps what a PC needs to learn is only taught by a particular religious sect at one temple in the far, distant north.

The Guide can let players know where they'll need to travel and who they'll need to talk to for training and advancement, or the following tables can be used to help generate a story.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  THE TRAINER IS... (D20)   
  ------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **1-12**                  where you expect them to be; a normal member of society.

  **13**                    retired.

  **14**                    isolated from society, living the hermit life. Getting to them will not be easy.

  **15**                    the head of a prestigious institution.

  **16**                    hiding in plain sight.

  **17**                    in prison.

  **18**                    kidnapped.

  **19**                    on retainer for the local lord.

  **20**                    a member of a rival adventuring party.

  **4**                                                   if you can provide them with some valuable information they have been seeking.   **14**   if you are able to defeat 3 of their students in challenges of STR, DEX, and WIL.

  **5**                                                   only to those with similar goals.                                                **15**   only to close friends.

  **7**                                                   only to those who would use these skills responsibly.                            **17**   only to members of the same clan or guild

  **8**                                                   if you are able to return their missing pet.                                     **18**   if you are able to prove your loyalty and dedication to their cause or ideology.

  **9**                                                   only to those who can solve their riddle.                                        **19**   if you can teach them something in return.

  **10**                                                  only to those who prove themselves worthy by fetching a rare item.               **20**   if you can prove that you don't need the skill.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Gaining HP

PCs can gain HP through experiences and knowledge that helps them stay alive in a dangerous world.

-   The first time a PC receives a **Permanent Wound** they *[gain 1d6 HP]{.underline}*. This bonus only applies for the PC's first Permanent Wound.

-   The first time a PC receives a **Scar** they *[gain 1d6 HP]{.underline}*. Roll this die after applying the Scar and its effects. This bonus only applies for the PC's first Scar.

# Combat

![P2170#yIS1]

Yoshitora Utagawa, *Battle at Uji River*, c. 1844, color ink woodblock triptych.

The approach to combat and everyday life should be the same.

\- Miyamoto Musashi

## Rounds

The game typically plays without strict time accounting. In a fight or circumstance where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when something occurs. A **round** is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and is comprised of **turns**.

*During the first round of combat*, each PC must make a DEX save in order to act before their opponents. Special circumstances, items, or skills may negate this requirement. PCs that fail their save will not act this round.

Opponents then take their turn, and the first-round ends. The next round begins with the PCs taking their turn, followed by their opponents, and so on until combat has ended with one side defeated or fled.

## Actions

On their turn, a PC may move up to 20ft or one **Range Band** (from Melee to Reach or Reach to Ranged, etc.) and take up to one action. This may be attacking, making a second move, or some other reasonable action.

Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky, the Guide calls for a save for appropriate players or NPCs. All actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously.

## Range Bands - Melee, Reach, and Ranged Attacks

**Maai** 間 (interval) is used in Japanese martial arts to denote the space between two opponents in combat. *Maai* is not a fixed distance, but rather the exact position from which one can strike their opponent, taking distance, angle, speed, and other factors into account.

When used to define actual distance between opponents, *issoku itto-no-maai* (*itto-ma or chuma*) is the distance equaling one step to make one strike.

The distance of an attack is driven by the story and falls into three abstract ranges: **melee**, **reach**, and **ranged**.

Characters may move from one distance to another adjoining distance as their move action. Characters may use their action to move another distance instead of attacking.

Each weapon has an optimal distance for its use. All weapons are either **melee**, **reach**, or **ranged**. Unless noted, a weapon is considered **melee**.

-   **Melee** - 近間 chikama (short distance) -- Combatants are very close to one another.

-   **Reach** -- 中間chuma (middle distance) **--** These weapons can extend the PC's attack range and keep a foe out of arms reach.

-   **Ranged** -- 遠間 toma (long distance) -- These weapons are able to attack foes from a distance.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  RANGE       DEFINITION           MELEE         REACH          RANGED
  ----------- -------------------- ------------- -------------- --------------
  Melee       Within arm's reach                 Disadvantage   Can not use

  Reach       A few feet away      Can not use                  Disadvantage

  Ranged      A bowshot away       Can not use   Can not use    
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ammunition is not tracked unless otherwise specified.

## Attacking and Damage

Attacks in combat automatically hit.

The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target\'s **Armor**, then deals the remaining total to their opponent\'s HP. If the opponent has no remaining HP, see **Critical Damage** (page [32]).

Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.

If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

Also note that only the weapon tag/effects of the highest result are used; it's as if only the highest result lands the blow.

If an attack would take a PC's HP exactly to 0, refer to the **Scars** **Table** (page [35]) to see how they are uniquely impacted.

## Attack Modifiers

**Weapon Type**: Weapons can deal 3 types of **damage**:

-   **Piercing**. Rolling the maximum value on your damage roll makes your attack ignore all armor. This ability only works if you use the regular damage die for the weapon (i.e., if you are using Impaired/Enhanced, not on an Impaired d4 attack.)

-   **Bludgeoning**. Always ignores 1 armor.

-   **Slashing**. Deals +1 damage against targets without armor.

**Advantage and Disadvantage** replaces the typical *Into the Odd* inspired **Enhanced** and **Impaired** mechanics. The traditional mechanics may be substituted if agreed upon by the Guide and players.

Attacks that are **Impaired**, such as firing through cover, or fighting while grappled, roll d4 Damage regardless of weapon.

Similarly, attacks that are **Enhanced** by a risky stunt or a helpless or vulnerable target, roll d12 Damage.

**Weapon Skill**: Many weapons have a specific Skill that provides an additional impact on combat. See **Weapons** (page [9]) for more information.

-   **Heavy X**: Ignore X points of ARMOR, but DAMAGE rolls of X or lower completely miss.

-   **Sweep X**: DAMAGE rolls of X or higher grant one bonus attack on another target in reach. You can't chain this effect for multiple bonus attacks.

-   **Counter X:** DAMAGE rolls of X or less against you are bounced back against your attacker.

-   **Shock X:** Damage rolls of X or higher trigger a STR Save - on a failure, the target loses its next turn.

-   **Quick X:** When deciding who goes first when up against a weapon of the same damage die, treat your DEX as being X higher.

**Advantage**: If fighting from a position of strength (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is at an **advantage**, allowing the attacker to roll 2 of their attack's damage dice and take the highest result.

**Disadvantage**: If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is at a **disadvantage,** and the attacker must roll 2 of their attack's damage dice and take the lowest result.

**Blast**: Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.

**Basic Strikes in Kenjutsu**

![P2241#yIS1]

1.  **Kiriotoshi**: overhead vertical cut

2.  **Migi kesagiri**: downward right to left "monk's robe" cut

3.  **Do**: horizontal cut

4.  **Migi kiriage**: upward right to left cut

5.  **Hidari kiriage**: upward left to right cut

6.  **Hidari kesagiri**: downward left to right "monk's robe" cut

7.  **Kote**: wrist cut

8.  **Tsuki**: thrust

**Dual Weapons**: If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result.

## Critical Damage

Damage that reduces a target\'s HP below 0 decreases a target\'s **STR** by the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid **Critical Damage**. On a success, the target is still in the fight and must continue to make Critical Damage saves when incurring damage.

Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a Critical Damage save.

Any character that suffers Critical Damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid and rest, they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour.

NPCs and monsters that fail a Critical Damage save are considered dead, per the Guide's discretion.

## Attribute Loss

-   If a PC\'s STR is reduced to 0, they die.

-   If a PC\'s DEX is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed.

-   If a PC\'s WIL is reduced to 0, they are delirious.

Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.

If a character takes damage outside of combat, they should instead receive damage to an **Attribute**, typically STR.

## Character Death

When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or take control of a retainer. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.

## Detachments

Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **detachment**. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are at a **disadvantage** (excluding blast damage).

Attacks against individuals by detachments are at an **advantage** and deal **Blast** damage.

## Wounds

**Wounds** are another element from *Block, Dodge, Parry* that provide the Guide a way to add depth to the game without overly complicating it.

These are different from **Scars** which have a more dynamic impact on characters.

Adventuring is dangerous. Wounds can come from a variety of sources:

-   Fire (such as from a burning building or a dragon's breath) can inflict **burns**.

-   Electricity (such as from magic or an ancient contraption) can inflict **nerve damage**.

-   Cold (such as from weather or magic) can inflict **frostbite**.

-   Poison can inflict **poisoning**.

Some creatures might inflict wounds when dealing **Critical Damage**, or on special attacks. Wounds can also be gained as a cost of player action (storming into a burning tavern to save one's treasure, for instance, might inflict burns).

A wound occupies a **slot** in your **inventory**. The type of wound is mechanically just flavoring, while in fiction a character with burns might have nasty blisters.

Wounds come in 3 levels.

-   **Light wounds** can be healed in the field, given that proper medicine and treatment is available. Light burns can be healed by gathering the right herbs and applying them overnight, for instance.

-   **Severe wounds** require serious medical attention, probably between adventures. Severe frostbite could be cured with a comfortable week-long rest in a healing temple.

-   **Permanent wounds** are just that, permanent. They can never be healed. Every permanent wound also lowers a fitting **Attribute** by -1 (For instance, WIL for nerve damage). While this -1 penalty can be overcome in time by training, the wounds' Inventory slot is forever lost.

Whenever a wound of the same type is gained, the player can choose to have their existing wound increase in severity or to fill in a new slot in their Inventory.

This allows player choice between short- or long-term impact: do you suffer another mild wound and heal after combat, or stack up to possibly permanent injury?

**Go no sen** is a combat technique in which a combatant takes the initiative after their opponent has started an attack. More than a move, it is a mental state requiring harmony with the moment of attack, not just defending.

Go no sen requires action at just the right moment to manipulate the attacker's ki (energy), strength, and momentum and end the attack.

Go no sen also represents a moral code where one should not strike first.

Wounds are intended to provide a **prompt for adventure**, with PCs gaining them as a consequence of decisions and curing them becoming adventures of their own.

### First Permanent Wound

The first time a PC receives a **Permanent Wound** they *[gain 1d6 HP]{.underline}*. PC's do not gain any more HP for subsequent **Wounds**. This represents the PC gaining experience and knowledge that helps them stay alive in a dangerous world.

## Retreat

Some battles cannot be won - and running away should always be a viable option. Just like in base *Cairn*, a successful **DEX** Save allows one to run away from a dangerous situation, as long as there is a safe place to run to.

Retreating from an enemy that is **not in Melee** range takes a **single action**.

Retreating from an enemy that is in **Melee** range takes **two actions** (one to create some distance, one to make the retreat attempt).

## Scars

**First Scar Inspired by:** McDowall, Chris, "Active Survival, Scars, and Afflictions," Bastionland, May 23, 2016. https://www.bastionland.com/2016/05/active-survival-scars-and-afflictions.html

Also added to **Permanent Wound** to expand PC growth.

If damage to a PC would reduce their HP to exactly 0, look up the result on the table based on the amount of HP lost in the attack. For example, if a PC went from 3 HP to 0 HP, they would look at entry #3 (Walloped).

### First Scar

The first time a PC receives a **Scar** they *[gain 1d6 HP]{.underline}*. Roll this die after applying the Scar and its effects.

This bonus only applies for the PC's first Scar.

  12    **Doomed:** Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived. If your next save against critical damage is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.

## Dueling

**Duels** between Japanese samurai weren't entirely common and are often highly romanticized in media. Often, when these duels did occur, they were agreed upon in advance and used non-lethal means, such as bokken or shinai instead of katanas.

The repeated clashing of blades would be rare, the preference being to dodge a strike entirely, as each clash would take chunks out of the blade. Most duels ended after one strike, with a typical fight involving footwork and positioning as each side sided the other up and sought the best moment for attack.

A duel can occur for many reasons: sport, test of skill, fame or pride, to settle insults, etc. But whatever the reason, dueling requires combatants to be entirely focused and prepared. All three **Attributes** are used when completing a duel.

### Dueling Saves

A duel consist of 3 contests that challenge each of a PC's Attributes:

1.  The **staredown** (WIL)

2.  The **draw** (DEX)

3.  The **clash** (STR)

During each contest, both sides make a **Save**.

A combatant **wins** if they roll **equal or under** their **Attribute** while the opposing side rolls **above** their **Attribute**.

-   If both combatants roll **above** their **Attribute**, it's a **draw**.

-   If both combatants roll **equal or under** their **Attribute**, the **lowest roll** **wins** and gains **advantage (roll 2d20, take the most beneficial result)** on the next **Save.**

-   If both combatants roll **equal or under** their **Attribute** and roll an **equal value**, it's a **draw**.

***Koiguchi no kirikat**a* or "cutting the carp's mouth" is the motion of "unlocking" a katana from the *koiguchi* of its *saya* (scabbard) by pressing the *tsuba* (handguard) with one's thumb.

The *koiguchi* (named for its shape like a koi's mouth) is meant to be perfectly fitted so the saya can be turned upside down without the blade falling out.

While *koiguchi no kirikata* could imply a fight was imminent, the concept of koiguchi san sun (3 sun or 9 cm from the koiguchi) during the Edo period meant that a sword was considered fully "drawn" once it reached this point.

### The Staredown

The battle of wills. Two opponents lock eyes, their hands hovering over their weapons. They thumb their katanas from their scabbards (*koiguchi no kirikata* or "cutting the carp's mouth"). A drop of sweat falls on the ground. The winner of this clash clearly has ice in their veins.

Both participants roll a save against **WIL**.

### The Draw

Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast -- but sometimes, slow just means *dead*. The **winner** of this contest is just *that* split-second quicker -- and primed to land a devastating blow.

Both participants roll a save against **DEX**.

### The Clash

Speed is one thing, but landing a blow still requires a certain degree of physical control: a strong follow-through, a decisive slash, a punishing blow.

Both participants roll a save against **STR**.

The **winner** of this contest rolls their **damage die** at an **advantage**, taking the **highest result**. The damage is done directly done to the loser's **STR** (but reduced by any **Armor** worn).

*Block, Dodge, Parry's* dueling rules are perfect for cinematic duels.

### Types of Duels

Consider any of the following dueling rulesets, depending on your setting:

-   **Friendly Duel**. Do not roll **damage** after the **Clash** -- simply keep track of who *could've* landed a serious blow.

-   **To The Death**. After the **Clash**, both parties roll for initiative as per normal combat, and duke it out.

-   **3 Touches**. After the **Clash**, combatants are expected to retake their position and duel again, until one side scores 3 hits. Depending on whether the duel is friendly or not, this could be simply for points, or a case of, "the aim is to get 3 points, and not die".

-   **The Dramatic Climax.** Use a 'best out of 3' structure. Damage is only done after one combatant wins the decisive clash -- the duels leading up to it represent a dramatic clashing of blades, moments to spout dramatic exposition or vengeful monologues.

# Travel and Encounters

Utagawa Kuniyoshi, *Clearing Weather on Ichihara Moor*, 1836, woodblock print.

Yes, the cherry trees put this truth very plainly: none of the glory of blossoms and autumn leaves lasts long in this fleeting world.

\- Murasaki Shikibu from The Tale of Genji

## Crawling

About 73% of Japan's land area is **mountainous.** The mountains are visible from just about any location within the archipelago.

Mountains have been revered as the home of kami -- spirits deities, even ancient ancestors -- but also as a place of spiritual pilgrimage (*tohai* -- mountaineering pilgrimage) and connecting with nature.

While the rules below contain guidelines on **Hexcrawling**, a Guide may use any system they are comfortable with for designing an adventure. The Guide should provide players with any necessary rules in advance.

## Hexcrawling

Overland travel is measured in hexes, each measuring 6 miles or +/-10 km across.

## Watches

A day is divided into three watches: **morning**, **afternoon**, and **night**.

For each watch, the party takes one action: Travel, Explore, Supply, Make Camp

### Travel

How many hexes a party can travel during a Watch is based on the terrain type and current weather.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DIFFICULTY     HEXES PER WATCH   EXAMPLE                       NOTES
  -------------- ----------------- ----------------------------- -----------------------------
  **Easy**       2 hexes           Plains, steppe, farmland      

  **Tough**      1 hex             Hills, woods, desert, rough   

  **Perilous**   1 hex             Mountains, jungle, swamps     +1 event die roll per Watch
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Travel on horseback:** +1 hex per Watch

The **Gokaido** are the five major roads originating from Edo. Formalized under Tokugawa Ieyasu, they were intended to help implement *sankin-kotai,* a policy requiring most daimyo to alternate between living in their domain and Edo*.*

Along each route were post stations (*shukuba*) where travelers could rest. Additional check stations were established for regulatory purposes.

Few bridges would be built, instead using ferry boats to cross waterways.

**Tokaido** was a coastal route with 53 stations, connecting to Kyoto.

**Nakasendo** had 69 stations and ran through the center of the island, connecting at Kusatsu-juku with the Tokaido.

**Koshu Kaido** traveled northwest with 44 stations before ending at the Nakasendo in Shimosuwa-shuku.

-   **Severe Weather:** -1 hex per Watch or add 1 Fatigue while traveling

-   **Night Travel:** +1 event die roll

Each time a party enters a new hex, roll on the **Wilderness Events** table (page [41][14]).

### Explore

-   One or more party members search a large area, searching for hidden features, scouting ahead, or treading carefully.

-   Roll a **Location** (page [42]) or **Feature** (page [41][15])

-   If the party has already explored a hex they cannot explore it again.

### Supply

-   One or more party members may hunt, fish, or forage for food, collecting 1d4 **Rations** (3 uses each). The chance of a greater bounty increases with each additional participant (e.g. 1d4 becomes 1d6, up to a maximum of 1d12). Relevant experience or equipment may also increase the bounty.

-   The party may encounter homes and small villages where they can resupply.

### Make Camp

-   The party stops to set up camp in the wilds. Each party member (and their mounts) consumes a **Ration**.

-   A lookout rotation is set so that the party can sleep unmolested. A smaller party may need to risk sleeping unguarded or switch off sleeping over multiple days.

-   Party members that were able to rest remove all **Fatigue** from their inventory.

### Fatigue

***Gokaido (continued)***

**Oshu Kaido** and its sub-routes had more than 100 stations, connecting with Matsu Province northeast.

**Nikko Kaido** ran through 17 stations with the Oshu Kaido, then an additional 4 stations before ending at the temples of Mangan-ji and Toshosha.

For each night the party skips ***making camp***, each PC gets one **Fatigue**.

### Weather

Each day, the Guide should roll on the weather table for the appropriate season. If the "Severe" weather result is rolled twice in a row, the weather turns to "Catastrophic." A squall becomes a hurricane, a storm floods the valley, etc.

#### Weather Table (2D6)

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  2D6                                    SPRING           SUMMER             FALL             WINTER

  9-11                                   Bright & sunny   Pleasantly sunny   Cool rain        Overcast

  12                                     Clear, warm      Wonderfully warm   Clear, warm      Clear, crisp

  *Italicized* results: Severe Weather                                                        
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Kamikaze***, or divine wind, originally referred to typhoons that ended Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281.

The first invasion in 1274 started with Mongol successes before being forced to withdraw after running into fierce resistance at Hakata Bay. It was during this withdrawal back to China when a typhoon hit, sinking one-third of the Mongol fleet of 500-900 ships and drowning an estimated 13,000 men.

During their second attempt in 1281, the Mongol fleet spent months searching for a suitable landing site. A typhoon caught the Mongol fleet at sea, sinking all but a few hundred of the 4,400 Mongolian ships and drowning nearly half of their 140,000 men.

### Wilderness Elements

#### Night

-   The party can choose to travel during the night and rest during the day, but night travel is far more dangerous. The Guide should roll twice on the **Wilderness Events** table (page [41][14]).

-   Some terrain and weather may be easier to traverse at night (desert, for example). The Guide should balance these challenges along with any other.

#### Sleep

-   The last watch of the day is typically reserved for the Make Camp action.

-   Characters typically need to sleep each day. Anything beyond a minor interruption can negate or cancel the benefits of sleep.

-   If the party skips the **Make Camp** action, they each add a **Fatigue** to their inventory and are **deprived**. Additionally, traveling when sleep-deprived raises the terrain **Difficulty** by a step (i.e. Easy becomes Tough).

#### Light

-   Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40-ft ahead of the party but beyond that only provides a dim outline of objects.

-   Characters without a light source may suffer from panic until their situation is remedied.

-   Environmental conditions (sudden gusts of wind, dust, water, etc.) can easily blow out a torch.

#### Light Sources

-   A torch can be lit 3 times before degrading.

-   A lantern can be relit indefinitely but requires a separate Oil Can (6 uses).[]{#_Ref176339197 .anchor}

  **1**                    Discovery     The party finds food, treasure, or other useful resources. The Guide can instead choose to reveal the primary feature of the area or roll on the **Terrain Features** (page [41][15]) table.

  **2**                    Sign          The party discovers a clue or indication of a nearby encounter, locality, hidden feature, or information about a nearby area or roll on the **Locations and Landmarks** (page [42]) table.

  **3**                    Environment   A shift in weather or terrain. Roll on **Weather** table (page [40]).

  **4**                    Loss          The party is faced with a choice that costs them a resource (rations, tools, etc), time, or effort.

  **5**                    Exhaustion    The party encounters a barrier, forcing effort, care or delays. This might mean spending extra time (and an additional Wilderness Action) or adding Fatigue to the PC's inventory to represent their difficulties.

  **6**                    Encounter     Roll on an **Encounter** table (page [44]) for that terrain type or location. Don't forget to roll for **NPC reactions** (page [54]) if applicable.

## Encounters (D20)

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  COASTAL ENCOUNTERS (D20)   
  -------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1                          A **Bandit** and 2 **Hunting Dogs** scour the beach, hunting for the entrance to a sea cave marked on a crude map.

  2-3                        Along the swollen banks of the river, murky waters churn and froth with the relentless force of the deluge. If players wish to cross they must pass a DEX save. If they fail, a **Kappa** attacks with an **Advantage** first attack.

  4-5                        As the party stops to consider an abandoned rowing boat bobs gently in the water, d4 **Kaizoku** jump out of the nearby foliage.

  6                          Beneath leaden skies, rain pelts relentlessly, soaking everything in its path. If players wish to continue travel, they must save DEX, if they fail, they lose 1 WIL.

  7                          A thick fog envelops the party, visibility diminished as the mist shrouds the surroundings in an eerie haze. If players wish to continue travel, they must save WIL, if they fail, they become lost and lose 2 Watch before the fog lifts. If they make camp for the day the fog lifts by morning.

  8                          The path turns muddy, soon two feet deep a tough to travel. Water in ditches bubbles, ominous signs of impending danger. If players wish to continue travel, they must save DEX, if they fail, they become bogged down and lose 1 Watch.

  9-10                       The party stumbles upon a desolate village, its charred remnants hinting at a recent attack. Exploring the ruins, they find a survivor, frightened and rambling. Roll on **NPC Encounter** (page [51]) and **Cryptic Advice and Warnings** (page [51][17]).

  11                         2 **Ashigaru** stand guard at an execution. The accused is buried up to their head below the high tide line. Amidst the gathered crowd, one voice cries out, insisting on the accused\'s innocence but the two guards are not moved.

  12-13                      D6 **Kaizoku** descend upon the party, seeking plunder and hostages.

  14                         D6 **Ashigaru** are on a quest to retrieve their fallen comrade.

  15                         D4 **Ashigaru** stand guard, blocking the path.

  16                         The party sees two **Kappa** sitting on waterside rocks.

  17                         A **Suiko** leaps from the water, its teeth glistening as much as its scaled hide.

  18                         Tentacles surge forth, a **Koromodako** emerging from crashing waves. If the party is on land they can flee without having to make a DEX save.

  19                         A woman on the shore cries for help, cradling her baby. If the party investigates, they find it's a **Nure onna** luring them into a trap. 1/3 chance that it's quickly joined by an **Ushi-oni** emerging from the rocks.

  20                         A titanic figure rises, an impossibly dark **Umi-bozu** dark blocking the sky.

  3-4                       D6 **Bandits** shift among the foliage, waiting to ambush the party.

  5-6                       A thick fog envelops the party, visibility diminished as the mist shrouds the surroundings in an eerie haze. If players wish to continue travel, they must save WIL, if they fail, they become lost and lose 2 Watch before the fog lifts. If they make camp for the day the fog lifts by morning.

  11-12                     The party comes across a campfire smoldering with fading embers, casting a warm glow against the surrounding darkness. Nearby lies the charred remnants of a roasted rabbit, its savory aroma lingering in the air. Yet, the campsite appears hastily abandoned.

  13                        A group of d4 **Ashigaru** is lost, led by a clueless **Samurai** who insists they know their way.

  14-15                     Clad in rugged armor, a **Ronin** claiming to be a professional monster hunter emerges from the woods.

  16                        A sweet voice sounds from the nearby woods, calling to members of the party to come join them. If the party investigates, they find a **Jorogumo** waiting on its web.

  17                        Amidst dense foliage, a gnarled **Jubokko** looms, its branches creaking as they twist and move, threatening to ensnare anything that strays too close.

  18                        The party spots a **Nomori** uncoiling itself from around a crushed bear as it begins to feast.

  19                        At first the party thinks they see a bear, but soon realize it's an **Onikuma** rummaging through the guts of a horse to pick out meaty remains.

  20                        A giggle in the woods gets the party's attention. The party's light source goes out. If they do not have another, a **Nikusui** emerges and begins her hunt.

| 20                         | An **Ushi-oni** emerges from its lair, skittering along spider-like legs, it's ox head breathing toxic poison.                                                                                                                                              |

  1-2                      A thick fog envelops the party, visibility diminished as the mist shrouds the surroundings in an eerie haze. If players wish to continue travel, they must save WIL, if they fail, they become lost and lose 2 Watch before the fog lifts. If they make camp for the day the fog lifts by morning.

  3                        Oh no, quicksand! Players must save DEX to avoid falling into the quicksand. If they fail, they must save STR to remove themselves. If they fail five STR saves in a row, they die. Members of the party not trapped in the quicksand can help retrieve stuck players with a STR save of their own.

  4                        Murky waters churn and froth with the relentless force of the deluge. If players wish to cross, they must pass a DEX save. If they fail, a **Kappa** attacks with an Advantage first attack.

  5                        As the party stops to consider an abandoned rowing boat bobs gently in the water, d4 **Kaizoku** jump out of the nearby foliage.

  6-7                      Beneath leaden skies, rain pelts relentlessly, soaking everything in its path. If players wish to continue travel, they must save DEX, if they fail, they lose 1 WIL.

  9                        2 **Ashigaru** stand guard at an execution. The accused is buried up to their head below the high tide line. Amidst the gathered crowd, one voice cries out, insisting on the accused\'s innocence but the two guards are not moved.

  10                       The party comes across a campfire smoldering with fading embers, casting a warm glow against the surrounding darkness. Nearby lies the charred remnants of a roasted rabbit, its savory aroma lingering in the air. Yet, the campsite appears hastily abandoned.

  11                       D4 **Ashigaru** stand guard, blocking the path.

  12                       A giggle in the woods gets the party's attention. The party's light source goes out. If they do not have another, a **Nikusui** emerges and begins her hunt.

  13                       A sweet voice sounds from the nearby woods, calling to members of the party to come join them. If the party investigates, they find a **Jorogumo** waiting in its web.

  14                       The party sees two **Kappa** sitting on waterside rocks.

  15                       A **Suiko** leaps from the water, its teeth glistening as much as its scaled hide.

  16                       A **Kuchisake-onna** glides forth, smiling, asking the party "Am I beautiful?"

  17                       The party spots a **Nomori** uncoiling itself from around a crushed bear as it begins to feast.

  18                       A huge **Omukade** crawls from a crevice, impossibly fast, dangerously ferocious.

  19                       Small blue orbs of flickering flame dance, a swarm of d6 **Onibi** threatening to swarm the party.

  20                       An **Ushi-oni** emerges from its lair, skittering along spider-like legs, it's ox head breathing toxic poison.

  12-13                    2 **Ashigaru** look from your party to a wanted poster and back again. Suspicion and uncertainty linger as wary gazes follow the party\'s every move.

  14                       Panic erupts in the streets as a frenzied mob of townsfolk flees through narrow alleyways, their terrified cries blending with the distant roar of an **Onryo**.

  15                       An **Amanojaku\'s** whisper drifts across the wind, promises of untold riches or power, suspicion of other party members trying to sway characters into anger.

  16                       A **Kuchisake-onna** glides forth, smiling, asking the party "Am I beautiful?"

  17                       An **Oni** emerges with thunderous steps, an iron club in its hands.

  18                       A **Wanyudo** rolls toward the party, its infernal flames casting eerie shadows.

  19                       An eerie glow a **Reiki** stands in the distance, the ghost of a dead oni seeking an outlet for its fury.

  20                       Your party stops and stares down an alleyway. You could have sworn you saw the floating head of a **Nukekubi**.

# Worldbuilding

See first with your mind, then with your eyes, and finally with your body.

\- Yagyu Munenori

![P3638#yIS1]

Utagawa Hiroshige, *Travelers on a Mountain Path at Night*, Ca 1851-2, woodblock print.

## Factions

A region is typically dominated by one or more factions, each with their own unique Perks, Agenda, and Obstacles. Each faction should also have one or more representatives, or Agents, tasked with helping complete their agenda. Smaller regions should have 1-2 factions, while larger regions could have as many as 5-6 factions.

### Agents

Agents are often in charge of completing one or more of the goals of the agenda of a faction. Particularly large factions may have additional agents, each in charge of a distinct goal. Agents may have personal motivations that differ from the faction's main agenda, a fact that canny PCs can exploit for their own gain.

### Perks

Factions possess perks that assist them in accomplishing their agenda. Perks reflect a faction's influence, materials, wealth, and other unique features. Factions leverage their perks as much as possible when trying to achieve their goals, and at the same time continually work to acquire more perks.

### Agendas

Factions will work to complete their agendas independently, enlisting the help of PCs only when that would strengthen their agenda. Agendas are defined by a series of 3-5 goals that build toward a clear objective. Goals are progressive, building on the previous successes (or failures) of earlier goals.

Goals should focus on acquiring a distinct advantage in order to proceed to the next goal. At least one goal should deal with the faction's primary obstacle. This may be the first goal, or the last. All agendas have at least one obstacle that stands in the way of their completion. Additional obstacles can arise through faction actions or through developments in the fiction.

Completing a faction's agendas should be a significant event, potentially changing the political or natural landscape of a region.

### Faction Types and Agents

Roll 1d20 for each.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Faction Rules

-   By default, factions operate independent of the player character's actions. If the PCs do nothing, the faction should still act to achieve their aims.

-   The Guide should rely on the fiction to determine whether a faction is positioned to advance their agenda.

-   Some goals may be time-sensitive or depend on explicit circumstances. Other times it might be more appropriate to introduce a new goal after a major event, alliance, or friction between one or more factions, etc.

-   Whenever a faction is positioned to advance a goal in their agenda, roll a d6 on the **Faction Actions** table.

-   If two factions are opposed, the faction most at risk makes a WIL save, using the score of its highest-ranking agent. On a fail, the faction does not roll on the **Faction Actions** table at this time.

#### Faction Actions (D6)

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  D6      CONSEQUENCE        IMPACT
  ------- ------------------ ---------------------------------------------------
  **1**   Major Success      A Goal is achieved and a new Advantage is found.

  **2**   Success            A Goal is achieved, and no Perks are lost.

  **3**   Mixed Success      A Goal is achieved, but a Perk is lost.

  **4**   Status Quo         Nothing is gained, but nothing is lost.

  **5**   Setback            A Perk is lost.

  **u**   Failure            A new Obstacle is introduced, and a Perk is lost.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The actions of the PCs can always overrule the necessity for a faction action, or in some cases shift the outcome of the roll in a favorable or unfavorable direction.

####  

## Naming Procedures

### Principles

-   Settlements are often named after their unique features: the shape of the river nearby, or the large windmill in the town center. The residents then add a noun or adjective: Windy Gulch, Black Tree Fort, etc.

-   Important places should have important names, like those of heroes, religious or political figures, and other events. The Chalet of Saint Ibiz, Queen's Harvest, Light of the Nine, etc.

-   Proper nouns can be added to or even replace parts of a name, e.g. Bruna's Ugly Gulch.

-   Wild and dangerous places are named after obvious hazards: Poison Lake, Foggy Cliffs, etc.

-   Some names tell a story: Luka's Folly, Dead Man's Path, etc.

-   Use the region's local terrain and the location's details where appropriate.

### Nouns (D100)

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  D100   NOUN         D100   NOUN           D100   NOUN          D100   NOUN

# Solo Play

![P5574#yIS1]

Utagawa Kuniyoshi, *Nichiren in Snow at Tsukahara, Sodo Province*, Ca. 1940, woodblock print, ink and color on paper.

It is good to face challenges in your youth. He who has never suffered will not sufficiently temper his character.

\- Yamamoto Tsunetomo

## Going Alone

Ikezu-ishi can also be played solo, with one person acting as both Guide and Player.

The role of the Guide is replicated by the use of tables to assist during moments of choice or help provide descriptions and ideas for open-ended questions.

Ikezu-ishi includes Yes/No oracles, tables to help generate random events, get Players out of an impasse, and flesh out NPCs. Players may also use any of the tables in this book or elsewhere to help generate their adventure.

## Yes/No Oracle (D6) 

**"Did the player find the thing?" Inspired by:** Tiago Junges "Searching for Something," *Ronin*, 2019, 8.

If you face a question that is not associated with any character attribute, you can use a Luck Roll as a Yes/No Oracle with 1d6.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  D6       RESULT
  -------- --------------------------------------------------------------
  **1**    Yes, and... (a boon for the PC)

  **2**    Yes

  **3**    Yes, but... (a toned-down outcome or another event)

  **4**    No, but... (a toned-down outcome, may not be negative)

  **5**    No

  **6**    No, and... (consequences for the PC)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Yes/No Oracle Variations

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Did the player dodge?                                                                                       Did the player find the thing?   
  ----------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  **1**                   Yes, and it caught the NPC off guard, giving them +1 damage to their next attack.   **1**                            Yes, but first they have to face an enemy.

  **2**                   Yes                                                                                 **2**                            Yes, but they drew a lot of attention

  **3**                   Yes, but they hurt themselves in the process and take 1 HP damage.                  **3**                            Yes, but it's not quite what they expected.

  **4**                   No, but they avoided the worst of it and take -1 damage from the attack.            **4**                            They don't find it.

  **5**                   No                                                                                  **5**                            They don't find it and draw a lot of attention.

  **6**                   No, and they stumbled, fell, etc. and take +1 damage from the attack.               **6**                            They don't find it and have to face an enemy.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Random Event Generator

After rolling, describe the nature of the event and the choices your make to determine the outcome.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  "HELP, I'M STUCK!" EVENT(D12)   
  ------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **1**                           **The "Raymond Chandler" solution**: Raymond Chandler famously wrote, \"When in doubt, have a man come through the door with a gun in his hand.\" In many cases this is just a combat encounter, but social "combat" is often more fitting. Or you could keep it literal: someone challenges your PC to a duel. Or they challenge an ally, in which case your PC is the second, or must try to stop the madness! The 'duel' need not be pistols at dawn; it could be a high-stakes game of cards, a speeder race, a bake-off\...

  **2**                           **Villain thought defeated reappears**: This can either be from the campaign or your PC's backstory. If you don't have a convenient villain, it's time to roll one up, and decide how they were defeated. The more melodramatic the proceedings, the more likely it is that they were (presumed) dead.

  **3**                           **Environmental catastrophe**: Fire, flood, earthquake, locusts, a rain of frogs... make it big. Or don't: heavy rains make the country roads into a mire, and father can't return home before the christening! Perhaps it's very localized: someone spills a drink / throws paint/ splashes mud down the front of your new gown!

  **4**                           **Betrayal**: Someone you thought an ally stabs you in the back, literally or otherwise. Why? How? Are they working with the villain now, or this a separate issue? How will you succeed without their support? How will you take revenge?

  **5**                           **Ally comes to character for help**: Someone close to you needs help badly. It may or not have any relation to the main plot. Who is it? How do they get the message to you (in person, telepathically, a thug delivering a ransom note...)? What do they need? Can you afford to drop everything to help them right now? What are the consequences if you don't, or can't, or refuse?

  **6**                           **Villain comes to character for help**: In addition to the questions of the entry above, you also need to figure out what could possibly motivate them to ask you for help. Does this mean you're friends now, or will things go back to normal once the crisis is over? The problem should be dire enough that not helping would cause more, perhaps even worse, problems for your PC and/or the world.

  EVENT (D12)   
  ------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **7**         New faction arises, shifting balance of power: Who are they? What do they want? Why are they opposed to you and the villain? Could either of you court their favor?

  **8**         **Find a mysterious item**: It could be anything: an ancient and indecipherable scroll, a locket with pictures inside, an abandoned ship, an obelisk in the midst of a field, a shoe... Where did it come from? Whose is it? How did it get there? What does it do? Is it dangerous? Is it intrinsically mysterious, or only mysterious because of where it was found?

  **9**         **Important item is lost/missing/stolen**: Yours or an ally's. It could be your +5 sword or your secret diary, all your iron rations, the emperor's signet ring, your favorite hat... Is it bad that it's missing because you can't succeed without it, or is it just dangerous in the wrong hands? Where did you see it last? Can you even remember? Did someone else want it? Is it incriminating if you left it in the wrong place?

  **10**        **A sudden death**: This actually is meant to be literal. Kill off a random NPC, important or otherwise \-- maybe even a generic one. Was it natural causes? murder? the start of a plague? Don\'t kill off the main villain unless the power vacuum created by their demise gives you more to do.

  **11**        **Affairs of the heart**: Someone declares their undying love for the PC or an ally -- or an ally for the villain! Maybe an ally needs your help.

  **12**        **Roll twice and combine the results**: It may or may not all happen at exactly the same time. It's possible that one result will preclude or forestall the other. Just keep the unused one as a new plot thread to introduce as soon as it becomes convenient. And the results may or may not be connected. Maybe being caught in the hyperspace flux is the reason the villain needs your aid... or declares their undying love for you!

# The Isle of Takashima

For a while there was finally peace.

Though the five most powerful clans did not make peace so much as fight each other into exhaustion.

In that moment of their collective lowest point, a summit was held and representatives from the Shihai, Daigo, Sanko, and Rakurai clans met, hammering out an agreement that would benefit each according to their strengths. The fifth clan, Kunimi, would come to terms soon after, joining the face of a multi-clan force standing outside their mountain stronghold, Akiyama.

The leader of Clan Shihai, who's strength allowed them to control most of the island, but who's wisdom initiated the summit, was granted the hereditary title of shogun, chief of the military and ruler of the nation, though the title's strength would be limited by a degree of autonomy held by the other major clans.

An economic boom followed. Sea routes reopened as roving navies went from looting to protecting. Trade grew as roads were formally established to allow for the quick and safe movement of goods across previously contested lands.

At the heart of it all was Mizuwa, Shihai's ancestral home and recognized capital of Takashima. From Mizuwa, four major roads spread to each of the other clans' capitals, Kunimi's Akiyama in the far northern mountains, Daigo's Nakashi in the west, Rakura's eastern port city of Kawaminato, and Sanko's Yanagi in the central plains. Jointly staffed stations built along each route protected and monitored transit, many turning into towns and cities of their own, luring families, nobles, and the underbelly looking to enrich themselves in this new world.

For the first time in memory, a generation was born and raised knowing only peace.

But trouble seethed under the surface. Lucrative sea routes were too ripe to be ignored, and pirates from the outer isles began to feast. Tension grew among the clan fleets as excuses for delayed actions were seen as cover for lack of concern. When a Daigo crew mutinied and turned their ship on a Rakurai trader, old rivalries reared their heads once more.

Inland, banditry skirted around the stations of the main roads, making the wilds off the beaten path unsafe to travel alone or unarmed. Temples and estates more secluded and bypassed by the main roads became havens and hives for groups of bandits and thieves. Clan efforts to confront these elements met the same distrust and tension as they found at sea. Every bandit a clan captured claimed loyalty to a competing clan, smiling even as the executioner's blow came down.

Shihai Takauji saw as many enemies as there were trees across Takashima and used this unrest as the first true test of the limits of his power as shogun. He called for the disarmament of the peasantry to ensure only samurai warriors carried weapons, hoping to limit the ability of others to turn to banditry.

Clans Sanko and Rakurai raised their voices in protest, both more dependent on peasants to boost their military strength to match that of the other clans. Takauji did not budge, citing the standing peace as making the need for peasant armies obsolete. His soldiers began confiscating weapons of travelers passing through stations along the five roads of Mizuwa.

In response, Takao, the daimyo of Kunimi, made the bold move of declaring every one of his clan's citizens samurai, allowing them to carry arms while conducting their daily business.

Takauji, citing the need for delineation between samurai and peasants in order to protect the interest of each, declared that samurai were to be restricted from farming, mining, or other jobs left to the peasantry. Trade would be prohibited between merchants and clans who could not prove the source of their goods, with stiff penalties for false and forged documents.

Takao had enough, recalling all of the Kunimi Clan's people to within its borders, even removing forces from all external jointly managed stations. Bandits seized the opportunity and began increasing their raids. Takao quickly sent out a call to rally the other clans in the name of unity but his missives went largely ignored, with only Clan Daigo submitting a token force to assist in guarding a few of the stations abandoned by Kunimi warriors.

It wasn't enough, and bandits swarmed, conquered, and destroyed the undermanned northern stations between Mizuwa and Akiyama. Supplies of ores and minerals from the mountains narrowed to a trickle that still managed to set sail from Kunimi ports to Kawaminato. Rakurai inspectors ignored Takao's trade restrictions, willing to accept the small fraction of what had arrived before.

Powerful families and estates within the clans began to have their faith shaken, with some choosing to create their own small fiefdoms of their citizens, lands, food, and loyal soldiers. Mercenary bands began to form from defecting warriors, bandits looking for a more honest living, and peasants who saw their lands stolen or absorbed by competing families and clans.

The Sanko Clan, with holdings more rural and vulnerable to banditry, would fracture under the stress, devolve into a multi-faction civil war as families fought for security, resources, or power they desperately craved. Daigo ships began halting and boarding traders out of Kunimi to confiscate the ore and minerals before they arrived at Kawaminato, and it wasn't long before war was declared openly on the seas.

Shihai Takauji, seeing the work of his ancestors crumbling around Mizuwa, seemed to panic, turning his back on his allies and the people of Takashima and pulling his forces and people closer to the capital. Vassals wishing to remain under the protection of Shihai were ordered to send family members to the capital as guests, perhaps a polite word for hostages, in an attempt to ensure stability and loyalty. Those unwilling to submit were left to determine their own fate.

The land and sea was once again covered in war as clans and families battled one another while holding off bandits and pirates and hoping to survive.

Clan Daigo, their navy reeling from Rakura and Kunimi ships and fearing their capital Nakashi, sent an envoy to Mizuwa to seek assistance from Shihai. Desperate for the resources and stability needed to maintain a nation, Takauji went further and secured an agreement that arranged for his eldest son, Akio, to be married to Daigo Kamako's only child, Tomoe, forming an alliance that would be further cemented under the leadership of the couple's future child.

Contact between the clans became limited, with fewer envoys being sent and even fewer merchants willing to travel the increasingly unsafe roads for trade. But years after recalling their citizens, Kunimi went quiet. Travelers brave enough to venture along the bandit plagued northern routes found abandoned stations and towns, with those returning bringing tall tales of monsters lurking within the shadow of the mountains -- and none getting close enough to Akiyama to return with any updates on its condition and the state of the Kunimi Clan.

While leaders of the southern clans largely ignored these stories, Shihai Akio set off to investigate, leaving a pregnant Tomoe behind with the promise of his swift return. News of Akio's death to unidentified forces would reach Mizuwa the same day as the birth of his son, Daichi.

Shihai Takauji would never learn of his son's death, or his grandson's birth, a bandit raid catching his party as he traveled to Nakashi. Takauji's retinue would be killed to the last, and rumors of Clan Daigo's involvement would spread in hushed whispers until Daigo Kamako released a proclamation declaring control over all of Shihai holdings and that Nakashi be recognized as the capital of Takashima.

Surprisingly, his daughter Tomoe would speak out against him, declaring her son, Daichi, the rightful heir and herself as regent until he would come of age. Neither Kamako nor Tomoe made any overt moves to further challenge the other, leaving a tense status quo across their holdings.

Now, the new year dawns. An aging Kamako still claims dominion over Daigo and Shihai and has named his son, Takashi, three years Daichi's junior, as his heir. Daichi, under his mother's guidance and the tutoring of Shihai military leaders, is preparing to lead with his coming-of-age mere months away. Rakurai ships rule the seas, raiding and harassing coastal towns, and Sanko infighting appears to be easing, with many families rallying around Sanko Hatsu, a young woman with claimed lineage to the gods who created the islands.

And all look to the mountains, wondering when Clan Kunimi -- or something worse -- might emerge.

# Appendix A: Principles for Players and Guides

## 

## Overview

**Neutrality --** The Guide's role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

**Classless --** A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry, and their experiences define their specialty.

**Death** -- Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.

**Fiction First --** Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the Guide in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements.

**Growth --** Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

**Player Choice --** Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

**Principles** -- The Guide and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

**Shared Objectives -** Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Players

**Agency**: Your character is defined by their actions. Be creative with your intuition, equipment, and relationships and use how your character has grown to inform your play.

**Teamwork**: Work together to determine goals and accomplish more as a group than alone.

**Exploration**: Ask questions, seek more information, and know there is no single correct way forward.

**Talking**: Treat NPCs like real people and work with them to move forward. Most people will want to talk things through before getting violent.

**Caution**: Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals. If you do fight, try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.

**Planning**: Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding. Do research and ask questions.

**Ambition**: Expect nothing. Earn your reputation. Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.

## Principles for Guides

**Information**: Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it. Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances. Be helpful, honest, and direct with your answers to their questions and remind players they can keep asking questions.

**Difficulty**: If something is easy to do, let the players do it without a save roll. Default to context and realism over numbers and mechanics. If something is impossible, no roll will allow them to do it and inform them. If a player is taking a sensible approach, let them do it. Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

**Preparation**: Be open to change. Use tables and generators to create situations, not stories or plots. NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the world. NPCs don\'t want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to live into every personality.

**Narrative Focus**: Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to facilitate improvement and specialization. Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path. A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.

**Danger**: The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player characters. Make sure the players know when danger is present, the more dangerous the more obvious. Put traps in plain sight and let players take time to figure out a solution. Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.

**Treasure/Loot**: A Treasure or Loot is specific to the environment from where it is recovered. It tells a story. It should be highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige. Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.

**Choice**: Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls. Use binary \"so, A or B?\" responses when their intentions are vague. Work together with this conversational progress to keep the game moving. Ensure that the player character\'s actions leave their mark on the game world.
