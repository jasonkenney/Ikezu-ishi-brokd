# Overview and Principles


    *Fall seven times, rise eight.*

<em>- Japanese proverb</em></p>



## Overview

**Classless – **A character’s role or skills are defined by the equipment they carry and their experiences, not their class.

**Fiction First – **Dice do not always reflect an obstacle’s difficulty or its outcome. Success and failure are arbitrated by dialogue, based on in-world elements.

**Growth – **Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

**Player Choice – **Players should understand the reasons behind their choices, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

**Principles** – The Guide and the players have guidelines to help foster a play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.


## Being Respectfully Inspired

The following are just a few examples of ways players can be inspired by a setting without devolving into a caricature of bad stereotypes.

**Don’t perpetuate stereotypes**: Research and get to know and enjoy aspects of the culture. Play a fleshed-out character, not an orientalist fantasy.

**Don’t do accents**: Describe how people talk and let your words show the character’s speech.

**Don’t obsess over honorifics in speech:** Over-usage isn’t necessary. If anything, default to degrees of politeness you may use yourself. You speak differently among friends than you do with grandma than you do with the boss.

**Don’t obsess over “honor” as a motivation**: The focus on “duty” and “honor” distills a character to a trope that can quickly be exaggerated.


## Combat As War


    *To win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.*

Combat in this game is not fair, but it is also not inevitable. Guides and players should seek different ways to resolve situations and encounters, using skills, equipment, and storytelling to create their adventure. While combat may not always be avoidable, facing an enemy requires strategizing and trying to stack the odds in your favor – and always being ready to retreat when things go wrong.
