<div id="yokai" class="section level2">

## Yokai

The label “yokai” encompasses a wide range of mythical creatures from Japanese folklore and tradition. Objects come to life. Creatures that closely resemble a cat or a fox or a hybrid of animal and human. Demons, ghosts, troll-like creatures, they run the whole spectrum.

Many are fairly harmless or just mischievous. Some are signs of blessing and luck. Others are more ominous and malicious, signs of doom or vicious themselves.

Presented here are a selection of generic yokai representing a range of violent or playful beings that can be used throughout the game. This is by no means an exhaustive list of yokai (for that visit <u>yokai.com</u>) but a start that should allow for a variety of encounters.

Like animals, there may be value for defeated yokai. Some may be protecting a horde (Oni are known for this) or a locality may have a bounty placed on their defeat. Any value is up to the story and at the Guide’s discretion.
