# HEX DESCRIBE BIBLE
# INTRODUCTION
#
# This is a collaborative document that can build a usable and varied
# hexcrawl with the click of a button for those times when you can’t
# prep or the players wander off the map. It is a group of tables that
# can populate hexes of different terrain types using the web apps Hex
# Describe and Text Mapper by Alex Schroeder. To use it, open this
# url:
#
# https://campaignwiki.org/hex-describe/load/random/smale
#
# Then copy this entire document and paste it into the box that says
# “paste your tables here” and click submit. Voila! Your own
# procedurally-generated 23x18 hex map, completely populated. Here’s a
# guide to start contributing to the project quickly:
#
# http://iceandruin.blogspot.com/2018/04/how-to-add-entries-to-hex-describe.html
#
# And here’s a more comprehensive tutorial written by Alex:
#
# https://campaignwiki.org/hex-describe/hel
#
# Format
#
# First, I’ve included “universal” tables that would be useful for all
# hex types - things like character traits, equipment, spells, etc.
# Add other universally useful tables here. The exception is tables of
# names - those go at the very end of the document because they’re
# long and take up so much space. There’s already like 70 pages of
# names.
#
# Then there are the sections for each hex type and their associated
# tables. The wilderness hex types are:
#
# forest, hill, forest-hill, forest-mountain, mountain, plains, swamp, water
#
#
# These all have the same format, and look like this:
#
# 0101 Hex type.
# Landmark:
# Encounter:
# NPC:
# Item:
#
# The settlement hex types are: farm, estate, town, market town, castle town, city
#
# castle, chaos, city, fields, keep,
# large-town, law, shrine, thorp, tower, town, village
#
# I’m still working on formats for these.
#
# A few conventions:
#
# Table names begin with a semicolon, and each entry begins with a
# weight number and comma. Everything else is a comment.
#
# Use comments copiously. Color them green.
#
# Bold the most important parts of longer entries by putting
# *asterisks* around them.
#
# For tables that are lists of things, include articles (as in “a
# sword”, not just “sword”). Don’t include articles when calling a
# list table (as in “The chest contains [object], not “The chest
# contains an [object]).
#
# To avoid confusion, don’t use abbreviations when naming tables.
#
# You can navigate much more easily by selecting “Show document
# outline” under the View menu. If you want your table to show up in
# the outline, set the table name text type to Heading 2 or Heading 3.
# I like to color them red.

The [personality trait] family is a member of the Mi Hi people and each married couple in Sea Home has a tentacle appendage.
1,Heavy brownish sea-foam washes in from the sea here and builds up on the pebbly beaches. It is merman sperm washed in from their breeding grounds in this hex. On the nights of the full moon, mermaids beach themselves and deposit their eggs in the sand.
1,In the weeds is a stilt hut where lives a desert hag who creates concoctions from the flowers of the Cursed Cowl. Her name is Morgmesh and she despises the Pale Lady.
1,Dolphin mating grounds.
1,Trained dolphins perform acrobatic feats to starboard, while their accomplices, Otter-folk, sneak aboard from larboard to steal. If noticed the Otter-folk will flee to the water, riding their dolphins getaway mammals.
1,The fast-moving lava and fresh water from the river meet here offshore, creating spiral rock formations underwater. The cooled lava deposits are rich with rare minerals.
1,An unpredictable whirlpool opens sporadically in this hex. Cumulative 10% chance per hour that it opens up somewhere interesting. The An-An believe that it leads to the underworld, and float their dead and dying into it on kayaks made from mud and reeds.
1,Aquatic vampires use tightly woven parachute-like nets to bring air down into the underwater caves here. The caves contain a variety of warm-blooded men and beasts which have been brought here from the surface. The vampires keep them alive on a diet of local sealife and use them as a replenishing source of nourishment.
1,A Greater Amphibious Scorpion makes its lair in a cave under the run-off of lava. (The Amphibious Scorpion is often sought for its carapace in the construction of various weapons/armour and most especially, the biologic variant of the Apparatus of Kwalish.)
1,Hidden amongst the treacherous rocky shoreline to the [direction] of this hex can be found the partially submerged ruins of the ancient Snake-man city of Si’ash Fass. Once majestic, it is now mostly a navigation hazard.
1,D4 male sperm whales are violently competing for a harem of 2d10+12 females. Ships approaching within 200 feet of the whales will be treated as new competitors.
1,Lair of Charybda the sea hag. Nobody would go here if not for her beautiful daughters and mage-wise sons. It is said that if you woo the sea hag, she will share the secret of immortality with you.
1,A small boat bobs upon the waves, its sail ruined. Inside is a skeleton clad in bright red leather armour, clutching a scroll case. Inside that is a drawing of the [hex trait] mountains.
1,A carpet of seaweed on a windless stretch of sea caught many sailors by surprise. Distant relatives of the sand goblins harvest the seaweed for food and are not beyond raiding ships stuck in this organic muck. Creatures lighter than 30 pounds can walk on the weed carpet, above 30 pounds make a dex check at -2 per 10 pounds over every turn or risk breaking the carpet and drown.
1,Saltenhaven, the swimming harbor and trade point of the sea elves. Main export is salt.
1,The kelp from this hex has the unusual property that if kept wet during &amp; after harvesting it will not rot and remains completely pliable. It will dry completely and permanently to the hardness and strength of hardwood of double its mass one turn after being exposed to air. The sea elves sell it in specially crafted earthenware pots by the yard.
1,Sea bulettes have gone in to a feeding frenzy around the corpse of an enormous harpoon-studded whale. Several canoes are headed away from the whale to the [direction].
1,A small island, just off the coast, connects to the mainland floodplain via a land bridge passable only at low tide. Here the marilith Semyaza has taken over a wizard's tower after a summoning gone wrong. She keeps the pretense of the reclusive wizard still living there while she builds a powerbase, but the inevitable deaths, disappearances and odd sightings have alerted the townsfolk there that something is dreadfully wrong
1,The Giant Turtle Huitzilihuitl lives, who lives amongst the reefs, is the only living witness of the rise and fall of the Snake-men.
1,Near the center of this area is an unbreakable glass tube with steps leading down under the waves. A series of 8 foot tall, magically lit tubes snake through the water, allowing excellent views of the local wildlife; pirate mages are using this as their hidden base.
1,The Imperial Seat of The Great Empire of Karakt-Zul floats high above the waters here on waves of magical energy being subtly sapped from the Sandstone Elementals, though none now living know this or much else of the ancient magics of this tremendous and beautiful &quot;City Above the Sea.&quot; Transport to and from the city is accomplished in giant scarab styled gondolas lifted by Rocs charmed and thus controlled by the Illustrious Vizier of the Aires. The beautiful Seranda el Teran, cousin to the Emperor, is the current holder of the powerful Amulet of Aire which confers this title and such control over Rocs, she will thus pay handsomely for the hatchlings of the [personality trait] Rocs or simply information about such.
1,The water here is extremely deep almost impossibly deep. At the bottom lurks some beast only knows as “The [hex trait] one”.
1,Several nuns from the [hex trait] monastery frolic in the shallows here. A reef of iridescent coral can be seen beneath the water. The coral is harvested by the nuns and made into enchanted jewelry. If anyone attempts to vex the nuns, a giant golem made of Coral will rise from the water and attack.
1,For the Giant Dragonflies and Wasps that breed in the [hex trait] fungus. The water here is a portal to *[castle name]*, and they fly back and forth often; this will work for any that ride them, although they are not easily tamed. For any not riding a Giant Dragonfly from this area it is a normal sea inlet.
1,*Cytorrak*, sorcerer and ancient nemesis of the *[personality trait] wizard* sails with a ship full of jackal-headed men to destroy his foe at last. He has no idea of the situation his foe has gotten himself into, and he will be confused.
1,ASPIDOCHELONE. Huge fish masquerading as a rocky island. In the little cottage on his back lives Judas Iscariot, looking like just another hermit. He has recently escaped from Hell and is hiding out from the Devil. He will try to get rid of his thirty pieces of silver - the Devil can smell them and will come after anyone who’s got one of them. You can only lose them if they’re stolen or if you pay someone to do something evil with them.

;water encounter
1,a *ghost ship*. [2d20] skeletons. The captain is an *Eye of Fear and Flame*. In the hold: [2d20] serpentmen. The skeletons have slain the rest and are sailing for the ends of the earth to toss their knowledge over the edge and erases those facts from existence.
1,*[3d4] Mind-controlled fish* with glowing pink, psychic worms poking out of their gills. They are swimming towards a good place to die to spread the young of the psychic worms. Such a plague could quickly decimate the ecosystem.
1,[2d10] malformed *leopard seals*. Huge tusks--teeth line their fins and undercarricages.
1,*Pirate patrol* that seeks slaves (50% chance their ship is already loaded with precious cargo). 10% chance actually ghost pirates from a ship that was ran aground in a storm (there may be treasure in the real wreck as well).
1,One of the *jellyfish* here is being remotely controlled by a mind flayer. He is using it to look for a *lost gem* in the shoals.
1,A *school of small green fish* that form strange arcane symbols.
1,*Overly large shark* with a suite of +1 chain in its belly.
1,A skinny *deep blue jelly* with tentacles and 2 vampire heads.
