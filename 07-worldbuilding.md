# Worldbuilding And Adventuring

See first with your mind, then with your eyes, and finally with your body.

\- Yagyu Munenori

The following pages include tools, tables, and advice for Guides running Ikezu-Ishi. This chapter offers resources and instructions for creating adventures and building dynamic worlds.

## Scenario Start Generator

> Inspired by: Sean Wills, “Random Ruins & Ronin Scenario Starts Generator,” Swords and Wizardry, archived March 31, 2016.

The Guide may use the following table to create the beginning of a scenario, providing a starting location, a contact, and a mission.

### The players meet in a village \[LOCATION\] with \[CONTACT\] who speaks of \[EVENT\] caused by \[CAUSE\].

## Factions

A region is typically dominated by one or more factions, each with their own unique Perks, Agenda, and Obstacles. Smaller regions should have 1-2 factions, while larger regions could have as many as 5-6 factions.

| 1-10 |               |     |               | 11-20 |              |     |            |

### Faction Agents (D20)

Agents are often in charge of completing one or more of the goals of the agenda of a faction. Particularly large factions may have additional agents, each in charge of a distinct goal. Agents may have personal motivations that differ from the faction’s main agenda, a fact that canny PCs can exploit for their own gain.

| D20 | AGENT      | D20 | AGENT         | D20 | AGENT     | D20 | AGENT      |
|:----|:-----------|:----|:--------------|:----|:----------|:----|:-----------|
| 1   | Academic   | 6   | Gravedigger   | 11  | Lord      | 16  | Peddler    |
| 2   | Assassin   | 7   | Guard/Soldier | 12  | Merchant  | 17  | Politician |
| 3   | Blacksmith | 8   | Healer        | 13  | Monk      | 18  | Spy        |
| 4   | Farmer     | 9   | Jailer        | 14  | Mystic    | 19  | Thief      |
| 5   | General    | 10  | Laborer       | 15  | Outlander | 20  | Thug       |

### Faction Perks

**Example Faction**

**Type:** Rulers: *Shihai Clan*. Disciplined, martial, stubborn.

**Perks: Conviction**: Firmly believe in their duty (and right) to lead the nation. **Position**: Traditionally observed as the leaders of the realm. **Wealth**: Their lands are among the most abundant throughout the nation.

**Agents:** (Lord) Shihai Daichi, heir to the Shihai daimyo title.

**Agenda:** Preserve order and reassert authority over the nation.

**Obstacles:** Opposed by other clans seeking authority.

Factions possess perks that assist them in accomplishing their agenda. Perks reflect a faction’s influence, materials, wealth, and other unique features. Factions leverage their perks as much as possible when trying to achieve their goals, and at the same time continually work to acquire more perks.

Roll d20 for the number of perks the faction has, then roll d20 again for the types of perks. Reroll repeated results.

| NUMBER OF PERKS (D20) |     |          |     |           |     |           |     |
|:----------------------|-----|----------|-----|-----------|-----|-----------|-----|
| 1-7                   | 2   | **8-12** | 2   | **13-17** | 3   | **18-20** | 4   |

| D20    | PERK        | D20 | PERK           |
|:-------|:------------|:----|:---------------|
| **1**  | Alliances   | 11  | Magic          |
| **2**  | Anonymity   | 12  | Members        |
| **3**  | Apparatus   | 13  | Popularity     |
| **4**  | Beliefs     | 14  | Position       |
| **5**  | Charisma    | 15  | Renown         |
| **6**  | Conviction  | 16  | Resources      |
| **7**  | Fealty      | 17  | Ruthlessness   |
| **8**  | Force       | 18  | Specialization |
| **9**  | Information | 19  | Subterfuge     |
| **10** | Lineage     | 20  | Wealth         |

### Faction Agendas

Factions will work to complete their agendas independently, enlisting the help of PCs when that would strengthen their agenda. Agendas are defined by a series of 3-5 Goals that build toward a clear objective. Goals are progressive, building on previous successes (or failures).

Goals should focus on acquiring a distinct advantage in order to proceed to the next goal. All factions have at least one obstacle that stands in the way of their completion. At least one goal should deal with the faction’s primary obstacle. Additional obstacles can arise through faction actions or through developments in the fiction.

Completing a faction’s agendas should be a significant event, potentially changing the political or natural landscape of a region.

Roll d20 for each column and combine.

| D20 | AGENDA | OBSTACLE |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **1** | Acquire assets/wealth | A geographic barrier or impassable terrain. |
| **2** | Control | A key piece of information must first be discovered. |
| **3** | Defeat or destroy faction/leader | A particular object or Relic is required. |
| **4** | Enrich members | A powerful figure or foe must be eliminated. |
| **5** | Exchange goods | Many must die, either as necessity or consequence. |
| **6** | Fame/Glory | A serious debt forces the faction to make dire choices. |
| **7** | Forge an alliance | A well-known prophecy predicts imminent failure. |
| **8** | Infiltrate faction | An alliance with an enemy must first be brokered. |
| **9** | Map the wild | An internal schism threatens to tear faction apart. |
| **10** | Overthrow order | Another faction has the same goal. |
| **11** | Preserve lineage/lore | Another faction stands in opposition. |
| **12** | Preserve the status quo/order | Vassals stand openly in opposition. |
| **13** | Produce goods | Considerable capital is required. |
| **14** | Protect/Reveal a secret | Hindered by cultural taboos. |
| **15** | Protect/defend themselves/something else | Contravenes an established code, with a heavy penalty. |
| **16** | Purge/eliminate traitors and/or competition | A rare but necessary resource must first be acquired |
| **17** | Revenge against a faction/leader | Must be carried out at a rare or exact moment. |
| **18** | Sell services/goods | Must be carried out in absolute secrecy. |
| **19** | Share knowledge/beliefs | Requires a specialist of an uncommon sort. |
| **20** | Survive | The outcome would lead to unavoidable conflict. |

### Faction Rules

The actions of the PCs can always overrule the necessity for a faction action, or in some cases shift the outcome of the roll in a favorable or unfavorable direction.

- By default, factions operate independent of the player character’s actions. If the PCs do nothing, the faction should still act to achieve their aims.

- The Guide should rely on the fiction to determine whether a faction is positioned to advance their agenda.

- Some goals may be time-sensitive or depend on explicit circumstances. Other times it might be more appropriate to introduce a new goal after a major event, alliance, or friction between one or more factions, etc.

- Whenever a faction is positioned to advance a goal in their agenda, roll a d6 on the **Faction Actions** table.

- If two factions are opposed, the faction most at risk makes a WIL save, using the score of its highest-ranking agent. On a fail, the faction does not roll on the **Faction Actions** table at this time.

#### Faction Actions (D6)

| D6    | CONSEQUENCE   | IMPACT                                            |
|:------|:--------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| **1** | Major Success | A Goal is achieved and a new Advantage is found.  |
| **2** | Success       | A Goal is achieved, and no Perks are lost.        |
| **3** | Mixed Success | A Goal is achieved, but a Perk is lost.           |
| **4** | Status Quo    | Nothing is gained, but nothing is lost.           |
| **5** | Setback       | A Perk is lost.                                   |
| **6** | Failure       | A new Obstacle is introduced, and a Perk is lost. |

>**Pointcrawl or Hexcrawl?**
>Ikezu-ishi uses Cairn’s Wilderness Exploration rules which utilizes a pointcrawl system. The Guide may choose to use a hexcrawl or any other adventure system they’re comfortable with.

## Locations, Landmarks, and Encounters

When needed, the Guide can roll or choose locations and landmarks using the General or terrain specific tables. If a result does not fit the location or the story, the Guide may reroll or choose a location.

For each encounter table, the Guide may roll a D20 for encounters that include yokai. If playing a game or in a setting where there are no yokai, the Guide may roll a D12.

### Coastal Encounters (D12 or D20)

| D12/20 | ENCOUNTER |
|:---|:---|
| 1 | A **Bandit** and 2 **Hunting Dogs** scour the beach, hunting for the entrance to a sea cave marked on a crude map. |
| 2-3 | D6 **Ashigaru** are on a quest to retrieve their fallen comrade. |
| 4-5 | As the party stops to consider an abandoned rowing boat bobs gently in the water, d4 **Kaizoku** jump out of the nearby foliage. |
| 6 | Beneath leaden skies, rain pelts relentlessly, soaking everything in its path. If players wish to continue travel, they must DEX save, if they fail, they lose 1 WIL. |
| 7 | Visibility diminishes as a mist shrouds the surroundings in an eerie haze. If players wish to continue travel, they must WIL save, if they fail, they become lost and lose 2 Watch before the fog lifts. If they make camp for the day the fog lifts by morning. |
| 8 | The path turns muddy, soon two feet deep a tough to travel. Water in ditches bubbles, ominous signs of impending danger. If players wish to continue travel, they must DEX save, if they fail, they become bogged down and lose 1 Watch. |
| 9-10 | The party stumbles upon a desolate village, its charred remnants hinting at a recent attack. Exploring the ruins, they find a survivor, frightened and rambling. Roll on **NPC Encounter** (page [73](ch008.xhtml#local-npc-encounter-d10)) and **Cryptic Advice and Warnings** (page [71](ch008.xhtml#cryptic-advice-and-warnings-d10)). |
| 11 | 2 **Ashigaru** stand guard at an execution. The accused is buried up to their head below the high tide line. Amidst the gathered crowd, one voice cries out, insisting on the accused's innocence but the two guards are not moved. |
| 12 | D4 **Ashigaru** stand guard, blocking the path. |
| 13-14 | Along the swollen banks of the river, murky waters churn and froth with the relentless force of the deluge. If players wish to cross they must pass a DEX save. If they fail, a **Kappa** attacks with an **Enhanced** first attack. |
| 15 | The party sees two **Kappa** sitting on waterside rocks. |
| 16-17 | A **Suiko** leaps from the water, its teeth glistening as much as its scaled hide. |
| 18 | Tentacles surge forth, a **Koromodako** emerging from crashing waves. If the party is on land they can flee without having to make a DEX save. |
| 19 | A woman on the shore cries for help, cradling her baby. If the party investigates, they find it’s a **Nure onna** luring them into a trap. 1/3 chance that it’s quickly joined by an **Ushi-oni** emerging from the rocks. |
| 20 | A titanic figure rises, an impossibly dark **Umi-bozu** dark blocking the sky. |
