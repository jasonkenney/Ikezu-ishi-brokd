## Dungeon Exploration

Although the term “dungeon” is used here, it can mean any dangerous or new locale (cities, castles, mansions, farmhouses, adventure site, etc.).

<div id="the-basics" class="section level3">

### The Basics

- The dungeon exploration cycle (see below) is divided into a series of **Turns**, **Actions**, and their consequences.

- On their Turn, a PC can move up to their torchlight’s perimeter (about 40ft) and perform one **Action**. Players can use their action to triple their move, though they risk a **Dungeon Event**.

- The Guide should present obvious information about an area and its dangers freely and at no cost. Moving quickly or without caution increases the chance of encountering a monster, springing a trap, or triggering a **Dungeon Events** roll.

</div>

<div id="dungeon-exploration-cycle" class="section level3">

### Dungeon Exploration Cycle

1.  The Guide describes the party’s surroundings and any immediate dangers (combat, traps, surprises, etc.). The players then declare their character’s intended movements and **Actions**.

2.  The Guide resolves the **Actions** of each character simultaneously, along with actions already in progress.

3.  The players record any loss of resources and any new conditions (i.e. item use, deprivation, etc). The cycle then begins again. If appropriate, the Guide should roll a **Dungeon Event**.

</div>

<div id="dungeon-events" class="section level3">

### Dungeon Events

Exploring a dungeon is always dangerous, and time must be weighed against the risks of encountering denizens, natural hazards, and worse. Roll on the **Dungeon Events** table below when the party:

- Spends more than one cycle in a single room or location.

- Moves into a new area, level, or zone.

- Moves quickly or haphazardly through a room.

- Creates a loud disturbance.

</div>

<div id="dungeon-events-d6" class="section level3">

### Dungeon Events (D6)

| D6 | EVENT | DESCRIPTION |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **1** | Quiet | The party is left alone (and safe) for the time being. |
| **2** | Sign | A clue, spoor, track, abandoned lair, scent, victim, etc is discovered. |
| **3** | Environment | Surroundings shift or escalate. Water rises, a ritual nears completion, etc. |
| **4** | Loss | Torches are blown out, etc. Must resolve the effects before moving on. |
| **5** | Exhaustion | Must take a rest (roll again), add a Fatigue, or consume a ration. |
| **6** | Encounter | Roll an **Encounter** (page [54](ch008.xhtml#id__Ref181610019)). Roll **NPC reactions** (page [73](ch008.xhtml#npc-reactions-2d6)) if needed. |

</div>

<div id="actions-1" class="section level3">

### Actions

<figure>
<img src="../media/image40.png" style="width:0.75in;height:0.9375in" alt="A drawing of a keyhole Description automatically generated" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A drawing of a keyhole Description automatically generated</figcaption>
</figure>

A ***kofun*** is a large, ancient burial mound built in Japan between the 3<sup>rd</sup>-7th centuries, typically for emperors, aristocrats, and powerful leaders. These mounds are often keyhole-shaped ranging from modest to monumental in size. Inside the tombs items like weapons, armor, and *haniwa* (clay figures) were often placed to accompany the deceased in the afterlife.

- Actions are any *non-passive activities*, such as searching for traps, forcing open a door, listening for danger, disarming a trap, engaging in combat, dodging a trap, running away, resting, etc.

- Some actions have special rules (see below), while others may take multiple **Turns** to complete.

- Loud or noticeable actions may also trigger an encounter with the dungeon’s denizens or trigger a **Dungeon Event**.

</div>

<div id="searching" class="section level3">

### Searching

- A character can spend a **Turn** performing an exhaustive search of one object or location in an area, revealing any relevant hidden treasure, traps, secret doors, etc.

- Larger rooms and difficult or complex dungeon terrain may take a few turns to properly search.

- Searching a room first is a safer way to explore the dungeon, but it has a steep cost: *time*.

</div>

<div id="resting" class="section level3">

### Resting

- A character can spend a **Turn** resting to restore all HP.

- A light source and a safe location are required to rest. *Present or oncoming danger makes rest impossible.*

- Resting can only restore Fatigue if the character is in a safe place and not at risk, such as in a tavern or after all threats are cleared.

</div>

<div id="panic" class="section level3">

### Panic

- A character that is surrounded by enemies, enveloped by darkness, or facing greatest fears may experience *panic*. A **WIL** save is typically required to avoid becoming panicked.

- A panicked character must make a **WIL** save to overcome their condition as an **Action** on their **Turn**.

- A panicked character has 0 HP, does not act in the first round of combat, and all of their attacks are **impaired**.

</div>

<div id="dungeon-elements" class="section level3">

### Dungeon Elements

<div id="light" class="section level4">

#### Light

- Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40ft of dungeon and beyond that only a dim outline of objects. Torches last until they are put out by a character or their environment.

- A torch can be lit 3 times before permanently degrading. A lantern can be relit indefinitely but requires an Oil Can (6 uses).

</div>

<div id="doors" class="section level4">

#### Doors

***Fusuma*** and ***shoji*** are sliding room dividers and doors seen in traditional Japanese architecture.

Shoji were translucent or transparent sheets on a lattice frame where fusuma were often opaque and painted with nature scenes or patterns.

Shoji would provide visual privacy while not blocking sounds, encourage inhabitants to speak and move softly, calmly, and gracefully.

Sliding doors were typically not locked, but in some instances could be secured with a bar, rope, chain, or metal lock.

- Doors and entryways may be locked, stuck, or blocked entirely. Characters can try to force a door open (or wedge it shut) using available resources (spikes, glue) or through raw ability.

- The party’s marching order determines who is most impacted by whatever lies beyond a door.

- A character can detect, through careful observation (listening, smelling, etc.), signs of life and other hazards through nearby doors and walls.

</div>

<div id="traps" class="section level4">

#### Traps

- A cautious character should be presented with any and all information that would allow them the opportunity to avoid springing a trap. An unwitting character will trigger a trap according to the fiction or will otherwise have a <u>2-in-6 chance</u>.

- Traps can usually be detected by carefully searching a room.

- Damage from traps is taken from attributes (usually **STR** or **DEX**) and not from **HP**. **Armor** can reduce damage, but only if applicable (e.g. a shield would not reduce damage from gas).

<span id="id__Ref179382855" class="anchor"></span>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div id="wilderness-exploration" class="section level2">

## Wilderness Exploration

***Uguisubari*** (nightingale floors) were used in the hallways of some temples and palaces and made a chipping sound went stepped upon. Used as a security device to alert of anyone sneaking through corridors, flooring nails would rub under floorboards when stepped on, causing a chirping noise.

<div id="watches" class="section level3">

### Watches

- A day is divided into three watches: **morning**, **afternoon**, and **night**.

- Each character can choose one Wilderness Action (page [40](ch007.xhtml#id__Ref178709589)) per watch.

- If the characters split up, each group is treated as an independent entity.

</div>

<div id="points" class="section level3">

### Points

- Potential destinations on a map are called points.

- One or more watches may be required to journey between two points on a map, depending on the path, terrain, weather, and party status.

- The party should have a rough idea of the challenges involved to get to their destination, but rarely any specifics.

</div>

<div id="travel-duration" class="section level3">

### Travel Duration

Travel time is counted in watches, divided into three eight-hour segments per day.

**Mountains** cover nearly 73% of Japan’s land area, visible from just about any location within the archipelago.

Mountains have been revered as the home of kami – spirits deities, even ancient ancestors – but also as a place of spiritual pilgrimage (*tohai* – mountaineering pilgrimage) and connecting with nature.

To determine the distance between two points, combine all penalties from the Path Type, Path Distance, Terrain Difficulty, and Weather Difficulty tables, taking into account any changes to those elements along the route. For travel via waterways, refer to the surrounding terrain difficulty. For especially vast terrain, assign a penalty of up to +2 watches to the journey.

Weather, terrain, darkness, injured party members, and other obstacles can impact travel or even make it impossible! In some cases, the party may need to add Fatigue or expend resources to sustain their pace. Mounts, guides, and maps can increase the party’s travel speed or even negate certain penalties.

</div>

<div id="path-type-and-distance" class="section level3">

### Path Type and Distance

| PATH TYPE  |             |                          | PATH DISTANCE |             |
|:-----------|-------------|--------------------------|:--------------|-------------|
| **Path**   | **Penalty** | **Odds of getting Lost** | **Distance**  | **Penalty** |
| Roads      | None        | None                     | Short         | 1 Watch     |
| Trails     | +1 Watch    | 2-in-6                   | Medium        | 2 Watches   |
| Wilderness | +2 Watches  | 3-in-6                   | Long          | 3 Watches   |

</div>

<div id="terrain-difficulty" class="section level3">

### Terrain Difficulty

| DIFFICULTY | PENALTY | TERRAIN | FACTORS |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Easy | None | Plains, steppe, farmland | Safe areas for rest, fellow travelers, good visibility. |
| Tough | +1 Watch | Hills, woods, deserts, forests | Wild animals, flooding, broken equipment, falling rocks, unsafe shelters, hunter’s traps. |
| Perilous | +2 Watches | Mountains, jungles, swamps | Quicksand, sucking mud, choking vines, unclean water, poisonous plants and animals, poor navigation. |

</div>

<div id="weather" class="section level3">

### Weather

Each day, the Guide should roll on the weather table for the appropriate season. If the “Severe” weather result is rolled twice in a row, the weather turns to “Catastrophic.” A squall becomes a hurricane, a storm floods the valley, etc.

</div>

<div id="weather-table-2d6" class="section level3">

### Weather Table (2D6)

| D6  | SPRING     | SUMMER     | FALL       | WINTER     |
|:----|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|
| 1   | Nice       | Nice       | Fair       | Fair       |
| 2   | Fair       | Nice       | Fair       | Unpleasant |

| 6   | Extreme    | Extreme    | Extreme    | Extreme    |

</div>

<div id="weather-difficulty" class="section level3">

### Weather Difficulty

| WEATHER | EFFECT | EXAMPLES |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Nice | Favorable conditions for travel. | Clear skies, sunny |
| Fair | Favorable conditions for travel | Overcast, breezy |
| Unpleasant | Add a Fatigue or add +1 watch | Gusting winds, rain showers, sweltering heat, chill air |
| Inclement | Add a Fatigue or add +1 watch. Increase terrain difficulty by a step. | Thunderstorms, lightning, rain, muddy ground |
| Extreme | Add a Fatigue *and* add +1 watch. Increase terrain difficulty by a step. | Blizzards, freezing winds, flooding, mud slides |
| Catastrophic | Most parties cannot travel under these conditions. | Tornados, tidal waves, hurricane, volcanic eruption |

</div>

<div id="wilderness-elements" class="section level3">

### Wilderness Elements

In folklore, nighttime encounters with spirits on dark, lonely roads, often served as tests of courage and virtue. Those who displayed kindness, bravery, or wisdom often escaped unharmed or were rewarded, while those who acted out of selfishness or fear could suffer dire consequences. Nighttime trials symbolized the moral strength needed to face the unknown and showed one’s true character in the face of threats.

<div id="night" class="section level4">

#### Night

- The party can choose to travel during the night and rest during the day, but night travel is far more dangerous. The Guide should roll twice on the **Wilderness Events** table (page [39](ch007.xhtml#id__Ref176339197)).

- Some terrain and weather may be easier to traverse at night (desert, for example). The Guide should balance these challenges along with any other.

</div>

<div id="sleep" class="section level4">

#### Sleep

- The last watch of the day is typically reserved for the **Make Camp** action.

- Characters typically need to sleep each day. Anything beyond a minor interruption can negate or cancel the benefits of sleep.

- If the party skips the **Make Camp** action, they each add a **Fatigue** to their inventory and are **deprived**. Additionally, traveling when sleep-deprived raises the terrain **Difficulty** by a step (i.e. Easy becomes Tough).

The **wilderness** was considered a sacred realm where kami, or spirits, resided in natural features like ancient trees, mountains, and rivers. This reverence led monks and ascetics to retreat to remote, mountainous areas for spiritual enlightenment, believing the harshness of nature would strengthen their minds and spirits. Folktales and legends spoke of yokai and tengu dwelling in the wilds, making the wilderness a place of both awe and caution.

</div>

<div id="light-1" class="section level4">

#### Light

- Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40-ft ahead of the party but only provides a dim outline of objects beyond.

- Characters without a light source may suffer from panic until their situation is remedied.

- Environmental conditions (sudden gusts of wind, dust, water, etc.) can easily blow out a torch.

</div>

<div id="light-sources" class="section level4">

#### Light Sources

- A torch can be lit 3 times before degrading.

- A lantern can be relit indefinitely but requires a separate Oil Can (6 uses).<span id="id__Ref176339197" class="anchor"></span>

</div>

</div>

<div id="wilderness-exploration-cycle" class="section level3">

### Wilderness Exploration Cycle

1.  The Guide describes the current point or region on the map and how the path, weather, terrain, or status might affect speed. The party plots or adjusts a course towards their destination.

2.  Each character chooses a single **Wilderness Action** (page [40](ch007.xhtml#id__Ref178709589)). The Guide narrates the results and then rolls on the **Wilderness Events** table. The party responds to the results.

3.  The players and the Guide record any loss of resources and new conditions (i.e. torch use, deprivation, etc) and the cycle repeats.

</div>

<div id="wilderness-events-d6" class="section level3">

### Wilderness Events (D6)

| D6 | EVENT | DESCRIPTION |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **1** | Discovery | The party finds food, treasure, or other useful resources. The Guide can instead choose to reveal the primary feature of the area or roll on the **Terrain Features** (page [40](ch007.xhtml#id__Ref178709589)) table. |
| **2** | Sign | The party discovers a clue or indication of a nearby encounter, locality, hidden feature, or information about a nearby area or roll on the **Locations and Landmarks** (page [55](ch008.xhtml#id__Ref179661174)) table. |
| **3** | Environment | A shift in weather or terrain. Roll on **Weather** table (page [38](ch007.xhtml#weather-table-2d6)). |
| **4** | Loss | The party is faced with a choice that costs them a resource (rations, tools, etc), time, or effort. |
| **5** | Exhaustion | The party encounters a barrier, forcing effort, care or delays. This might mean spending extra time (and an additional Wilderness Action) or adding Fatigue to the PC’s inventory to represent their difficulties. |
| **6** | Encounter | Roll on an **Encounter** table (page [54](ch008.xhtml#id__Ref181610019)) for that terrain type or location. Don’t forget to roll for **NPC reactions** (page [73](ch008.xhtml#npc-reactions-2d6)) if applicable. |

<span id="id__Ref178709589" class="anchor"></span>The **Gokaido** are the five major roads originating from Edo. Along each route were post stations *(shukuba)* where travelers could rest. Many of these stations would become towns and trading hubs.

**Tokaido** was a coastal route with 53 stations, connecting to Kyoto.

**Nakasendo** ran through the island’s center with 69 stations, connecting with the Tokaido at Kusatsu-juku.

**Koshu Kaido** traveled northwest with 44 stations before ending at the Nakasendo in Shimosuwa-shuku.

**Oshu Kaido** connected with Matsu Province in the northeast with its sub-routes and more than 100 stations.

**Nikko Kaido** ran through 17 stations with the Oshu Kaido, then 4 stations before reaching Mangan-ji and Toshosha.

</div>

<div id="wilderness-actions" class="section level3">

### Wilderness Actions

<div id="travel" class="section level4">

#### Travel

- Typically taken by the entire party. Obvious locations, features, terrain of nearby areas are revealed according to their distance.

- The party rolls 1d6 to see if they get lost along the way. This risk can increase or decrease, depending on **Path Type** and **Terrain Difficulty** (pg. 40), maps, party skills, and guides.

- If lost, the party may need to spend a **Wilderness Action** to recover their way. Otherwise, the party reaches the next point.

</div>

<div id="explore" class="section level4">

#### Explore

- One or more party members search a large area, searching for hidden features, scouting ahead, or treading carefully.

- Roll a **Location** or **Feature** (page [54](ch008.xhtml#id__Ref181610019))

- A **Travel** action is required to leave the current area, even if it has been completely explored.

</div>

<div id="supply" class="section level4">

#### Supply

- One or more PCs may hunt, fish, or forage for food, collecting 1d4 **Rations** (3 uses each). Relevant experience, equipment, and additional participants increase the chance of a greater bounty (e.g. 1d4 becomes 1d6, up to a maximum of 1d12).

- The party may encounter homes and small villages where they can resupply.

</div>

<div id="make-camp" class="section level4">

#### Make Camp

- The party stops to set up camp in the wilds. Each party member (and their mounts) consumes a **Ration**.

- A lookout rotation is set so that the party can sleep unmolested. A smaller party may need to risk sleeping unguarded or switch off sleeping over multiple days.

- Party members able to rest remove all **Fatigue** from their inventory.

- If the party skips **Making Camp**, each PC gets one **Fatigue**.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div id="downtime" class="section level2">

## Downtime

**Horses** were expensive to keep and maintain. With much of Japan’s low lying lands dedicated to cultivation, there was little left for pastures.

Samurai were expected to train in “the way of the bow and the horse” but among peasantry and merchants, should one be able to afford a horse they were more often used as pack animals.

Between game sessions, players can engage in a variety of activities such as research, following up on leads, improving skills, or building relationships. A PC is limited to one Downtime Action at a time. These actions cannot be undertaken in unsafe conditions or while a character is in recovery. A character cannot perform a downtime action if it would put their safety at risk.

<div id="milestones" class="section level3">

### Milestones

For activities requiring multiple steps, the Guide assigns 1-5 Milestones for players to track progress. Each Milestone represents a comprehensive, non-interactive task. The Guide may present different strategies to achieve these goals, each with distinct Milestones. Depending on the unfolding events in the game, the Guide is also empowered to introduce new Milestones or discard existing ones.

<div id="costs" class="section level4">

#### Costs

For samurai in the Sengoku period, **Bugeiyonmon** was emphasized, the “four skills” covering swords, horses, bows and guns. Sometimes there would be “six skills” (rikuegi) by including spear and jujitsu.

PCs can complete individual Milestones by taking a Downtime Action and paying its respective Cost. If a character is unable to pay the Cost, they may have to find some other way to achieve their goal. A few examples of Cost:

- Gold: Direct payment of gold from a character’s inventory.

- Resources: Non-monetary costs, such as material goods, specific common items, and so on.

- Reputation: Betting on a character’s renown, personality, presence, social connections, etc.

- Loss: Offering something specific and unique. A finger, a soul, a Relic, etc.

Some Costs can be reduced or disregarded through character skills, connections, or force of will. For example, a PC may have already acquired the necessary reputation to gain access to a renowned institution, and thus the cost is abated. On the other hand, another character may not be so lucky and must rely on their force of personality instead. In this case, the Guide should state the risk (a permanent ban on entry, a loss of reputation, etc.). The PC then makes a WIL save; on a success, the cost is either reduced or avoided entirely.

</div>

</div>

<div id="downtime-actions" class="section level3">

### Downtime Actions

Peasants had limited access to formal education or research sources, with most knowledge being passed down orally through families, communities, and apprenticeship systems.

In some cases, local temples and monasteries served as informal centers of knowledge. Commercial leading libraries (*kashihonya*) would emerge during the Edo Period, providing access to knowledge if one was able to read.

The following activities represent some of the most common Downtime Actions a players can choose. The Guide can also create custom actions based on the needs of play.

</div>

<div id="research" class="section level3">

### Research

A PC investigates a single question about a bit of lost or forgotten lore, the location of a lost item, the whereabouts of an important NPC, and so on. To take this action, the player must have a clearly formulated question they’d like to answer and a Source of knowledge in the game world that their character can interact with. If the PC does not have a Source, then they can spend a Downtime Action trying to find one. There is no guarantee that they will be successful. Once a question is posed and an appropriate Source has been identified, the Guide should provide any Milestones and associated Costs.

<div id="questions" class="section level4">

#### Questions

As always, the question must come from an experience that occurred during play.

Examples:

- “Where is the Lost Temple of East Nipoor?”

- “Who in Fortune City might know how to crack an ancient vault?”

</div>

<div id="sources" class="section level4">

#### Sources

A Source is a person, place, faction, or entity that holds either a part or whole answer that the character seeks. They can be NPCs, Factions, spirits, or even other PCs.

Examples:

- Kewr the Mouth, a frequent contact for the Conclave of Merchants. Despite their excellent relationship with this faction, asking for help in an illicit activity might come at a high cost.

- A Woodwose who makes his home deep in the Forest of Knives. The party encountered him in an earlier expedition, and the encounter did not end well. Still, he is said to know the nature of every herb and their healing properties.

</div>

<div id="training" class="section level3">

### Training

**Bugei Juhappan** is a list developed by Hirayama Gyuzo of 18 combat techniques and martial arts during the Tokugawa Period. These techniques were used by samurai and adopted by civilians to foster discipline, agility, and mental fitness.

The list includes various styles or schools (*ryu*) which in turn influenced other martial arts.

**Kyujutsu**, archery.

**Bajutsu**, horseriding.

**Sojutsu**, fighting with a spear (yari)

**Kenjutsu**, fencing.

**Suieijutsu**, swimming in armor.

**Iaijutsu**, sword-drawing.

**Tantojutsu**, knife-fighting.

**Juttejutsu**, fighting with a jutte (truncheon).

**Shurikenjutsu**, throwing shuriken.

**Fukumibarijutsu**, needle-spitting.

**Naginatajutsu**, fighting with a naginata.

**Hojutsu**, shooting with firearms.

**Hojojutsu**, tying up an opponent.

**Yawara**, grappling and fighting unarmed.

**Bojutsu**, fighting with a staff (bo).

**Kusarigamajutsu**, fighting with a chain-and-sickle.

**Mojirijutsu**, fighting with a barbed staff.

**Ninjutsu**, espionage.

<div id="weapon-types-and-skills" class="section level4">

#### Weapon Types and Skills

Training requires finding a trainer for a specific skill. This can be to gain a bonus to an attribute, with a specific weapon type or skill, or other advancements.

Training occurs at a specific location – finding a school that specifically teaches naginatajutsu (fighting with a naginata) – or with an individual – finding a thief to teach how to pick a lock.

- Hiring a trainer will cost 10 ryo per day (or other incentives other than ryo).

- Players must say how long their PC is training for and pay the Ryo cost before rolling for a success.

- When the number of days has passed, PCs must roll **d10 equal to or under the number of days** they trained to gain a modifier.

- PC’s gain +1 to the target roll under number for each time they successfully trained for this skill in the past.

- A player must always roll to see if they gain the modifier, even if the target number is greater than 10.

- A 10 is an automatic failure.

Modifiers gained by training are temporary and only last 30 days of in-game time, unless the PC has successfully trained again for that skill during that time.

PCs may train for different modifiers provided they have the time and ryo necessary.

PCs cannot stack modifiers. Training for the same skill when the PC already has a modifier only resets the 30-day expiration clock.

</div>

<div id="increasing-abilities" class="section level4">

#### Increasing Abilities

A PC can increase their Abilities through training.

- This training costs 200 ryo per week.

- At the end of the week, the player rolls a D20. If the roll is above their current maximum ability score, it increases by 1.

- An ability cannot be raised above 18.

#### Crucial Saves

Abilities can also be increased by failing Ability Saves in dramatic moments. When a player is about to make a dramatic, important Save in a moment with high stakes, the Guide can declare it a Crucial Save. After laying out the consequences of success and failure within the fiction, the player rolls their dice. If they fail the Save, the used Ability has its maximum increased by 1.

#### Finding A Trainer

Not every town or village necessarily has the same available resources as another. Same goes for training – there may be a region better known for certain skills than others. Perhaps what a PC needs to learn is only taught by a particular religious sect at one temple in the far, distant north.

The Guide can let players know where they’ll need to travel and who they’ll need to talk to for training and advancement, or the following tables can be used to help generate a story.

### Strengthening Ties

A character fosters a connection with an NPC or Faction in the game world. First, they must identify the entity with whom they wish to strengthen ties, as well as a specific intent (e.g., building trust, mending a friendship, seeking membership in a Faction, forming an alliance, and so on). The Guide then provides concrete measures (described as Milestones and Costs) that the PC can undertake to advance the relationship. With each completed Milestone, the Guide describes how the PC’s relationship has grown or changed.

Examples:

- During a play session, a PC becomes friendly with an Agent of the Order of the Helm. Impressed by the Order’s values, the PC asks what the requirements are to join.

- An agent for a powerful faction dies during the Battle of Frogs while under the party’s care. The party wishes to provide redress, so that the party can once again perform tasks for that faction.
