# Setting: The Isle of Takashima {#setting:-the-isle-of-takashima}

For a while there was finally peace. 

Though the five most powerful clans did not make peace so much as fight each other into exhaustion. 

In that moment of their collective lowest point, a summit was held and representatives from the Shihai, Daigo, Sanko, and Rakurai clans met, hammering out an agreement that would benefit each according to their strengths. The fifth clan, Kunimi, would come to terms soon after, joining the face of a multi-clan force standing outside their mountain stronghold, Akiyama.

The leader of Clan Shihai, who’s strength allowed them to control most of the island, but who’s wisdom initiated the summit, was granted the hereditary title of shogun, chief of the military and ruler of the nation, though the title’s strength would be limited by a degree of autonomy held by the other major clans.

An economic boom followed. Sea routes reopened as roving navies went from looting to protecting. Trade grew as roads were formally established to allow for the quick and safe movement of goods across previously contested lands.

At the heart of it all was Mizuwa, Shihai’s ancestral home and recognized capital of Takashima. From Mizuwa, four major roads spread to each of the other clans’ capitals, Kunimi’s Akiyama in the far northern mountains, Daigo’s Nakashi in the west, Rakura’s eastern port city of Kawaminato, and Sanko’s Yanagi in the central plains. Jointly staffed stations built along each route protected and monitored transit, many turning into towns and cities of their own, luring families, nobles, and the underbelly looking to enrich themselves in this new world.

For the first time in memory, a generation was born and raised knowing only peace.

But trouble seethed under the surface. Lucrative sea routes were too ripe to be ignored, and pirates from the outer isles began to feast. Tension grew among the clan fleets as excuses for delayed actions were seen as cover for lack of concern. When a Daigo crew mutinied and turned their ship on a Rakurai trader, old rivalries reared their heads once more.

Inland, banditry skirted around the stations of the main roads, making the wilds off the beaten path unsafe to travel alone or unarmed. Temples and estates more secluded and bypassed by the main roads became havens and hives for groups of bandits and thieves. Clan efforts to confront these elements met the same distrust and tension as they found at sea. Every bandit a clan captured claimed loyalty to a competing clan, smiling even as the executioner’s blow came down.

Shihai Takauji saw as many enemies as there were trees across Takashima and used this unrest as the first true test of the limits of his power as shogun. He called for the disarmament of the peasantry to ensure only samurai warriors carried weapons, hoping to limit the ability of others to turn to banditry.

Clans Sanko and Rakurai raised their voices in protest, both more dependent on peasants to boost their military strength to match that of the other clans. Takauji did not budge, citing the standing peace as making the need for peasant armies obsolete. His soldiers began confiscating weapons of travelers passing through stations along the five roads of Mizuwa.

In response, Takao, the daimyo of Kunimi, made the bold move of declaring every one of his clan’s citizens samurai, allowing them to carry arms while conducting their daily business. 

Takauji, citing the need for delineation between samurai and peasants in order to protect the interest of each, declared that samurai were to be restricted from farming, mining, or other jobs left to the peasantry. Trade would be prohibited between merchants and clans who could not prove the source of their goods, with stiff penalties for false and forged documents.

Takao had enough, recalling all of the Kunimi Clan’s people to within its borders, even removing forces from all external jointly managed stations. Bandits seized the opportunity and began increasing their raids. Takao quickly sent out a call to rally the other clans in the name of unity but his missives went largely ignored, with only Clan Daigo submitting a token force to assist in guarding a few of the stations abandoned by Kunimi warriors.

It wasn’t enough, and bandits swarmed, conquered, and destroyed the undermanned northern stations between Mizuwa and Akiyama. Supplies of ores and minerals from the mountains narrowed to a trickle that still managed to set sail from Kunimi ports to Kawaminato. Rakurai inspectors ignored Takao’s trade restrictions, willing to accept the small fraction of what had arrived before.

Powerful families and estates within the clans began to have their faith shaken, with some choosing to create their own small fiefdoms of their citizens, lands, food, and loyal soldiers. Mercenary bands began to form from defecting warriors, bandits looking for a more honest living, and peasants who saw their lands stolen or absorbed by competing families and clans.

The Sanko Clan, with holdings more rural and vulnerable to banditry, would fracture under the stress, devolve into a multi-faction civil war as families fought for security, resources, or power they desperately craved. Daigo ships began halting and boarding traders out of Kunimi to confiscate the ore and minerals before they arrived at Kawaminato, and it wasn’t long before war was declared openly on the seas.

Shihai Takauji, seeing the work of his ancestors crumbling around Mizuwa, seemed to panic, turning his back on his allies and the people of Takashima and pulling his forces and people closer to the capital. Vassals wishing to remain under the protection of Shihai were ordered to send family members to the capital as guests, perhaps a polite word for hostages, in an attempt to ensure stability and loyalty. Those unwilling to submit were left to determine their own fate.

The land and sea was once again covered in war as clans and families battled one another while holding off bandits and pirates and hoping to survive.

Clan Daigo, their navy reeling from Rakura and Kunimi ships and fearing their capital Nakashi, sent an envoy to Mizuwa to seek assistance from Shihai. Desperate for the resources and stability needed to maintain a nation, Takauji went further and secured an agreement that arranged for his eldest son, Akio, to be married to Daigo Kamako’s only child, Tomoe, forming an alliance that would be further cemented under the leadership of the couple’s future child.

Contact between the clans became limited, with fewer envoys being sent and even fewer merchants willing to travel the increasingly unsafe roads for trade. But years after recalling their citizens, Kunimi went quiet. Travelers brave enough to venture along the bandit plagued northern routes found abandoned stations and towns, with those returning bringing tall tales of monsters lurking within the shadow of the mountains – and none getting close enough to Akiyama to return with any updates on its condition and the state of the Kunimi Clan.

While leaders of the southern clans largely ignored these stories, Shihai Akio set off to investigate, leaving a pregnant Tomoe behind with the promise of his swift return. News of Akio’s death to unidentified forces would reach Mizuwa the same day as the birth of his son, Daichi.

Shihai Takauji would never learn of his son’s death, or his grandson’s birth, a bandit raid catching his party as he traveled to Nakashi. Takauji’s retinue would be killed to the last, and rumors of Clan Daigo’s involvement would spread in hushed whispers until Daigo Kamako released a proclamation declaring control over all of Shihai holdings and that Nakashi be recognized as the capital of Takashima.

Surprisingly, his daughter Tomoe would speak out against him, declaring her son, Daichi, the rightful heir and herself as regent until he would come of age. Neither Kamako nor Tomoe made any overt moves to further challenge the other, leaving a tense status quo across their holdings.

Now, the new year dawns. An aging Kamako still claims dominion over Daigo and Shihai and has named his son, Takashi, three years Daichi’s junior, as his heir. Daichi, under his mother’s guidance and the tutoring of Shihai military leaders, is preparing to lead with his coming-of-age mere months away. Rakurai ships rule the seas, raiding and harassing coastal towns, and Sanko infighting appears to be easing, with many families rallying around Sanko Hatsu, a young woman with claimed lineage to the gods who created the islands.

And all look to the mountains, wondering when Clan Kunimi – or something worse – might emerge.

## Five Roads from Mizuwa

Each of the five main roads of Takashima begin in the capital of Mizuwa and are named for the home cities of each of the four major clans where the roads officially end. There are many side routes, offshoots, and shortcuts, but the Five Roads system marked the formal roads that were protected by the clans. Jointly administered Stations or Post Towns were established along each route at roughly one day of travel apart, providing accommodations for travelers and administrators. Many of these Stations would become regional hubs of trade for local farmers and artisans, with regular markets providing access to goods for locals and travelers.

Since the start of recent tensions, many stations have found themselves without leadership from the clans, in some cases being overrun by bandits or abandoned entirely, making travel between the major cities nearly as treacherous as wandering the wilderness.

## Location: Tohoku

The coastal town of Tohoku (“East-North”) is the fifth station along the Kawanminato-Yanagi Road, where the two roads diverge when heading north from the capital Mizuwa. Once managed by three clans, Tohoku was a growing hub of commerce and travel for the eastern portion of the country, with a pre-war population of more than 4,000 residents. But since the war, many have fled to the security of castle towns or seats of power. Only the Shihai Clain retains any semblance of control in Tohoku, loosely through the local Magistrate’s Council, though Rakurai agents and Sanko families still eye the town for its strategic significance.
