# Combat
*The approach to combat and everyday life should be the same.*

<em>- Miyamoto Musashi</em>

## Rounds

The game typically plays without strict time accounting. In a fight or circumstance where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when something occurs. A **round** is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and is comprised of **turns**.

*During the first round of combat*, each PC must make a DEX save in order to act before their opponents. Special circumstances, items, or skills may negate this requirement. PCs that fail their save will not act this round.

Opponents then take their turn, and the first-round ends. The next round begins with the PCs taking their turn, followed by their opponents, and so on until combat has ended with one side defeated or fled.


## Actions

On their turn, a PC may move up to 20ft or one **Range Band** (from Melee to Reach or Reach to Ranged, etc.) and take up to one action. This may be attacking, making a second move, or some other reasonable action.

Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky, the Guide calls for a save for appropriate players or NPCs. All actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously.


## Range Bands -  Melee, Reach, and Ranged Attacks

The distance of an attack is driven by the story and falls into three abstract ranges: **melee**, **reach**, and **ranged**.

Characters may move from one distance to another adjoining distance as their move action. Characters may use their action to move another distance instead of attacking.

Each weapon has an optimal distance for its use. All weapons are either **melee**, **reach**, or **ranged**. Unless noted, a weapon is considered **melee**.



* **Melee** - 近間 chikama (short distance) – Combatants are very close to one another.
* **Reach** – 中間chuma (middle distance)** – **These weapons can extend the PC’s attack range and keep a foe out of arms reach.
* **Ranged** – 遠間 toma (long distance) – These weapons are able to attack foes from a distance.** **

Ammunition is not tracked unless otherwise specified.


## Attacking and Damage

Attacks in combat automatically hit.

The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's **Armor**, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP. If the opponent has no remaining HP, see **Critical Damage**. 

Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.

If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

Also note that only the weapon tag/effects of the highest result are used; it’s as if only the highest result lands the blow.

If an attack would take a PC’s HP exactly to 0, refer to the **Scars** **Table** to see how they are uniquely impacted.


## Attack Modifiers

**Weapon Type**: Weapons can deal 3 types of **damage**:

* **Piercing**. Rolling the maximum value on your damage roll makes your attack ignore all armor. This ability only works if you use the regular damage die for the weapon (i.e., if you are using Impaired/Enhanced, not on an Impaired d4 attack.)
* **Bludgeoning**. Always ignores 1 armor.
* **Slashing**. Deals +1 damage against targets without armor.

**Weapon Skill**: Many weapons have a specific Skill that provides an additional impact on combat. See **Weapons** for more information.

* **Heavy X**: Ignore X points of ARMOR, but DAMAGE rolls of X or lower completely miss.
* **Sweep X**: DAMAGE rolls of X or higher grant one bonus attack on another target in reach. You can’t chain this effect for multiple bonus attacks.
* **Counter X:** DAMAGE rolls of X or less against you are bounced back against your attacker.
* **Shock X:** Damage rolls of X or higher trigger a STR Save - on a failure, the target loses its next turn.
* **Quick X:** When deciding who goes first when up against a weapon of the same damage die, treat your DEX as being X higher.

**Advantage**: If fighting from a position of strength (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is at an **advantage**, allowing the attacker to roll 2 of their attack’s damage dice and take the highest result.

**Disadvantage**: If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is at a **disadvantage,** and the attacker must roll 2 of their attack’s damage dice and take the lowest result.

**Blast**: Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result. 

**Dual Weapons**: If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result.


## Critical Damage

Damage that reduces a target's HP below 0 decreases a target's **STR** by the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid **Critical Damage**. On a success, the target is still in the fight and must continue to make Critical Damage saves when incurring damage.

Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a Critical Damage save.

Any character that suffers Critical Damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid and rest, they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour.

NPCs and monsters that fail a Critical Damage save are considered dead, per the Guide’s discretion.


## Attribute Loss



* If a PC's STR is reduced to 0, they die. 
* If a PC's DEX is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. 
* If a PC's WIL is reduced to 0, they are delirious. 

Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.

If a character takes damage outside of combat, they should instead receive damage to an **Attribute**, typically STR. 


## Character Death

When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or take control of a retainer. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.


## Detachments

Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **detachment**. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are at a **disadvantage** (excluding blast damage).

Attacks against individuals by detachments are at an **advantage** and deal **Blast** damage.


## Wounds

Adventuring is dangerous. Wounds can come from a variety of sources:



* Fire (such as from a burning building or a dragon’s breath) can inflict **burns**.
* Electricity (such as from magic or an ancient contraption) can inflict **nerve damage**.
* Cold (such as from weather or magic) can inflict **frostbite**.
* Poison can inflict **poisoning**.

Some creatures might inflict wounds when dealing **Critical Damage**, or on special attacks. Wounds can also be gained as a cost of player action (storming into a burning tavern to save one’s treasure, for instance, might inflict burns).

A wound occupies a **slot** in your **inventory**. The type of wound is mechanically just flavoring, while in fiction a character with burns might have nasty blisters.

Wounds come in 3 levels. 



* **Light wounds** can be healed in the field, given that proper medicine and treatment is available. Light burns can be healed by gathering the right herbs and applying them overnight, for instance.
* **Severe wounds** require serious medical attention, probably between adventures. Severe frostbite could be cured with a comfortable week-long rest in a healing temple.
* **Permanent wounds** are just that, permanent. They can never be healed. Every permanent wound also lowers a fitting **Attribute** by -1 (For instance, WIL for nerve damage). While this -1 penalty can be overcome in time by training, the wounds’ Inventory slot is forever lost.

Whenever a wound of the same type is gained, the player can choose to have their existing wound increase in severity or to fill in a new slot in their Inventory. 

This allows player choice between short- or long-term impact: do you suffer another mild wound and heal after combat, or stack up to possibly permanent injury?

Wounds are intended to provide a **prompt for adventure**, with PCs gaining them as a consequence of decisions and curing them becoming adventures of their own.


### First Permanent Wound

The first time a PC receives a **Permanent Wound** they *<span style="text-decoration:underline;">gain 1d6 HP</span>*. PC’s do not gain any more HP for subsequent **Wounds**. This represents the PC gaining experience and knowledge that helps them stay alive in a dangerous world.


## Retreat

Some battles cannot be won - and running away should always be a viable option. Just like in base *Cairn*, a successful **DEX **Save allows one to run away from a dangerous situation, as long as there is a safe place to run to.

Retreating from an enemy that is **not in Melee range** takes a **single action**.

Retreating from an enemy that is in **Melee** range takes **two actions** (one to create some distance, one to make the retreat attempt).


## Scars

If damage to a PC would reduce their HP to exactly 0, look up the result on the table based on the amount of HP lost in the attack. For example, if a PC went from 3 HP to 0 HP, they would look at entry #3 (Walloped).


### First Scar

The first time a PC receives a **Scar** they *<span style="text-decoration:underline;">gain 1d6 HP</span>*. Roll this die after applying the Scar and its effects.

This bonus only applies for the PC’s first Scar.

## Dueling

A duel can occur for many reasons: sport, test of skill, fame or pride, to settle insults, etc. But whatever the reason, dueling requires combatants to be entirely focused and prepared. All three **Attributes** are used when completing a duel.


### Dueling Saves

A duel consist of 3 contests that challenge each of a PC’s Attributes:



1. The **staredown** (WIL)
2. The **draw** (DEX)
3. The **clash** (STR)

During each contest, both sides make a **Save**.

A combatant **wins** if they roll **equal or under** their **Attribute** while the opposing side rolls **above** their **Attribute**.



* If both combatants roll **above** their **Attribute**, it’s a **draw**.
* If both combatants roll **equal or under** their **Attribute**, the **lowest roll** **wins** and gains **advantage (roll 2d20, take the most beneficial result)** on the next **Save.**
* If both combatants roll **equal or under** their **Attribute** and roll an **equal value**, it’s a **draw**.


### The Staredown

The battle of wills. Two opponents lock eyes, their hands hovering over their weapons. They thumb their katanas from their scabbards (*koiguchi no kirikata* or “cutting the carp’s mouth”). A drop of sweat falls on the ground. The winner of this clash clearly has ice in their veins.

Both participants roll a save against **WIL**. 


### The Draw

Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast – but sometimes, slow just means *dead*. The **winner** of this contest is just *that* split-second quicker – and primed to land a devastating blow.

Both participants roll a save against **DEX**.


### The Clash

Speed is one thing, but landing a blow still requires a certain degree of physical control: a strong follow-through, a decisive slash, a punishing blow.

Both participants roll a save against **STR**.

The **winner** of this contest rolls their **damage die** at an **advantage**, taking the **highest result**. The damage is done directly done to the loser’s **STR** (but reduced by any **Armor** worn).


### Types of Duels

Consider any of the following dueling rulesets, depending on your setting:

* **Friendly Duel**. Do not roll **damage** after the **Clash** – simply keep track of who *could’ve* landed a serious blow.
* **To The Death**. After the **Clash**, both parties roll for initiative as per normal combat, and duke it out.
* **3 Touches**. After the **Clash**, combatants are expected to retake their position and duel again, until one side scores 3 hits. Depending on whether the duel is friendly or not, this could be simply for points, or a case of, “the aim is to get 3 points, and not die”.
* **The Dramatic Climax.** Use a ‘best out of 3’ structure. Damage is only done after one combatant wins the decisive clash – the duels leading up to it represent a dramatic clashing of blades, moments to spout dramatic exposition or vengeful monologues.
