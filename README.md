### Introduction

**Ikezu-Ishi** (Malicious Rock) is a feudal Japan inspired hack of **Cairn** by Yochai Gal, **Into the Odd** by Chris McDowall, and **Block, Dodge, Parry** by Lars Huijbregts. Players are citizens of a land in the midst of war and fear, many just trying to survive, some trying to get rich, others just seeking the thrill of adventure.

Throughout this book you will find side notes that include examples, clarifications, citations, historical information, and more. They are presented for informational purposes and any impact on the game is optional.

The rules and tables in **Ikezu-Ishi** are meant to help players create a vibrant setting and adventure for one or many play sessions. While inspired by Japanese mythology and feudal society, Ikezu-ishi is not meant to be a history book and can be quite anachronistic, mixing political, social, and cultural elements from the Kamakura Period (1192-1333) through the early Tokugawa (Edo) Period (1603-1868). Efforts have been made to avoid stereotypes, orientalism, and interchanging Asian cultures, though there are some existing historical influences from China, Korea, and elsewhere.
