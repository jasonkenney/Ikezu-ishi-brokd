# Setting: The Isle of Takashima

*The third dynasty would last barely more than two generations.*

When the young Emperor Yukio died before coming of age, the Third Dynasty and Imperial line died with him and so too did the remaining unity of Takashima.

Shihai, the clan closest to the imperial family and hereditary owners of the title of Shogun, tried to hold the nation together, but the damage had already been done by Yukio’s father, Emperor Suji.

Clan Kunimi had recalled its people to within its borders, removing forces from all external jointly managed stations. Bandits seized the opportunity and began increasing their raids. Supplies of ores and minerals from the mountains narrowed to a trickle that still managed to set sail from Kunimi ports to Rakura’s Kawaminato.

Powerful families and estates within the clans began to have their faith shaken, with some choosing to create their own small fiefdoms of their citizens, lands, food, and loyal soldiers. Mercenary bands began to form from defecting warriors, bandits looking for a more honest living, and peasants who saw their lands stolen or absorbed by competing families and clans.

The Sanko Clan, with holdings more rural and vulnerable to banditry, would fracture under the stress, devolve into a multi-faction civil war as families fought for security, resources, or power they desperately craved. Daigo ships began halting and boarding traders out of Kunimi to confiscate the ore and minerals before they arrived at Kawaminato, and it wasn’t long before war was declared openly on the seas.

Shogun (in name only) Shihai Takauji, seeing the work of his ancestors crumbling around the capital of Mizuwa, turned his back on his allies and the people of Takashima and pulled his forces and people closer to the capital. Vassals wishing to remain under the protection of Shihai were ordered to send family members to the capital as guests, perhaps a polite word for hostages, in an attempt to ensure stability and loyalty. Those unwilling to submit were left to determine their own fate.

The land and sea was once again covered in war as clans and families battled one another while holding off bandits and pirates and hoping to survive.

Clan Daigo, their navy reeling from Rakura and Kunimi ships and fearing for their capital Nakashi, sent an envoy to Mizuwa to seek assistance from Shihai. Desperate for the resources and stability needed to maintain a nation, Takauji went further and secured an agreement that arranged for his eldest son, Akio, to be married to Daigo Kamako’s only child, Tomoe, forming an alliance that would be further cemented under the leadership of the couple’s future child.

Contact between the five clans became limited, with fewer envoys being sent and even fewer merchants willing to travel the increasingly unsafe roads for trade. But years after recalling their citizens, Kunimi went quiet. Travelers brave enough to venture along the bandit plagued northern routes found abandoned stations and towns, with those returning bringing tall tales of monsters lurking within the shadow of the mountains – and none getting close enough to Akiyama to return with any updates on its condition and the state of the Kunimi Clan.

While leaders of the southern clans largely ignored these stories, Shihai Akio set off to investigate, leaving a pregnant Tomoe behind with the promise of his swift return. News of Akio’s death to unidentified forces would reach Mizuwa the same day as the birth of his son, Daichi.

Shihai Takauji would never learn of his son’s death, or his grandson’s birth, a bandit raid catching his party as he traveled to Nakashi. Takauji’s retinue would be killed to the last, and rumors of Clan Daigo’s involvement would spread in hushed whispers until Daigo Kamako released a proclamation declaring control over all of Shihai holdings and that Nakashi be recognized as the capital of Takashima.

Surprisingly, his daughter Tomoe would speak out against him, declaring her son, Daichi, the rightful heir and herself as regent until he would come of age. Neither Kamako nor Tomoe made any overt moves to further challenge the other, leaving a tense status quo across their holdings.

Now, the new year dawns. An aging Kamako still claims dominion over Daigo and Shihai and has named his son, Takashi, three years Daichi’s junior, as his heir. Daichi, under his mother’s guidance and the tutoring of Shihai military leaders, is preparing to lead with his coming-of-age mere months away. Rakurai ships rule the seas, raiding and harassing coastal towns, and Sanko infighting appears to be easing, with many families rallying around Sanko Hatsu, a young woman with claimed lineage to the Imperial Family.

And all look to the mountains, wondering when Clan Kunimi – or something worse – might emerge

<div id="five-roads-from-mizuwa" class="section level2">

## Five Roads from Mizuwa

Each of the five main roads of Takashima begin in the capital of Mizuwa and are named for the home cities of each of the four major clans where the roads officially end. There are many side routes, offshoots, and shortcuts, but the Five Roads system marked the formal roads that were protected by the clans. Jointly administered Stations or Post Towns were established along each route at roughly one day of travel apart, providing accommodations for travelers and administrators. Many of these Stations would become regional hubs of trade for local farmers and artisans, with regular markets providing access to goods for locals and travelers.

Since the start of recent tensions, many stations have found themselves without leadership from the clans, in some cases being overrun by bandits or abandoned entirely, making travel between the major cities nearly as treacherous as wandering the wilderness.

Barefoot I leave it.  
My coming, my going —  
Two simple happenings  
That got entangled.
